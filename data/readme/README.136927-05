NOTE 2:  By using Sun System Firmware (Firmware) you agree to the 
         terms of the Software License Agreement and Entitlement 
         (SLA/Entitlement) found in
 
         Sun_System_Firmware-6_6-download_SLA_and_Entitlement.txt.  
 
         By using the Firmware, you agree to the terms of the 
	 SLA/Entitlement.  If you do not  agree to all the terms 
         promptly destroy the unused Firmware.
 
NOTE 3:  This patch supports both the Sun Fire T2000 and the APL SPARC
         Enterprise T2000 product lines, which share the same firmware.  
         We include two separate Sun System Firmware binary files, with 
         different names corresponding to the respective products. 
         The different names are provided for convenience - the two 
         files are otherwise identical. 
 
         The system may experience boot or other problems with earlier 
         version of Solaris (S10_HW2).
 
         SPARC Enterprise T2000 (APL) configurations require 
         Solaris 10 11/06 (Update 3), or later, to be installed. 
 
NOTE 4:  Please refer to online documentation for feature and version
         compatibility between Sun System Firmware and LDom Manager 
         releases.
 
         LDoms release notes are available on http://docs.sun.com
         under this title and part number:
 
         Logical Domains (LDoms) 1.0.3 Release Notes 820-4895
 
NOTE 5:  If you are currently using LDoms 1.0 or 1.0.1 software, 
         you must perform a full upgrade procedure to upgrade to 
         LDoms 1.0.3 software. 
 
         Refer to Logical Domains (LDoms) 1.0.3 Administration Guide, 
 	 820-4894, at http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/prod/ldoms#hic. 
         You do not need to destroy configurations created with 
         LDoms 1.0.2 software; you only need to upgrade the software.
