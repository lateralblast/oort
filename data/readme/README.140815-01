Installation Instructions:
 
--------------------------------
 This Patch has three disk drive Firmware Installer Utilities.
 
 1. This patch includes firmware installing utility (mload) that
 is required for installing drive firmware in SE3510 RAID enclosures.
 2. This patch includes firmware downloading utility (download)
 that will upgrade or download code to drives in NON-RAID and in RAID
 pass through environments.
 
 The script(s) are intended for use on Sun host systems only.
 
***********************************************************************
 
 To install the contents of this Patch see the pertinent section below.

 A. Initial Installation Instructions.
 B. SE3510 System Installation Instructions
 C. Non RAID System Installation Instructions
 
 
 
 A. **************** Initial Installation Instructions************
 
 
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownnership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
5. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
6. Follow the instructions given in sections B and C. You may program one 
   drive, a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 
1. General guidelines for upgrading:
 
        BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
 
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
 
        UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.
 
        UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
 
        REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
        volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
        not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
 
        UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
        the procedure section below.
 
        In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the
        relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be
        that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen
        as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file
        being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.
 
**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting of the Solaris 2.6 release CD. Please be
            advised that you cannot see the ultra3 scsi card with solaris 2.10
            media.
            You also cannot use rm6 from the solaris 2.10 media and there are
            other circumstances under which 2.6 is not usefull. But it will work
            in many cases.
 
**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligible for upgrade.
 
        RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.
 
**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.
 
**NOTE**    This patch is for SUN SE31xx, SCSI JBOD and A3xxx series only The
            patch CANNOT be downloaded if the drives are in a RAID environment
            EXCEPT for SE31xx, A1000, A3000 and A3500.
            Before installing this patch any and all Software AND OR
            Hardware RAID should be disabled EXCEPT for SE31xx, A1000, A3000 and
            A35xx.
 
 
**Patch install example**
1. Download the patch from sunsolve to the /tmp directory.
3. ftp the 140815-01.tar.Z file to the /tmp directory in the machine used to monitor 
   the system.

B. ******************SE3510 System Installation Instructions ***************
 
  Note: For Non RAID System Installation Instructions go to Section D .
 
 Do not use the SCCLI or SSCS disk drive firmware download functions. Use this patch only to
download f/w.
 
 *For out-of-band upgrades, an Ethernet connection for the StorEdge
   3510, or two connections if dual controllers are installed, with an
   IP address assigned, allowing the user to connect to the array via
   telnet, or a serial connection supporting a tip(1) connection to the
   array.  Refer to the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family Installation,
   Operation, and Service Manual for the Sun StorEdge 3510 Fibre Channel Array,
   section 4.7 for procedures to connect to the array via tip.  Refer
   to the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family Installation, Operation, and Service
   Manual for the Sun StorEdge 3510 Fibre Channel Array, Appendix B, section B.2
   for procedures to connect to the array via telnet.
 
 * For in-band upgrades, a Fibre Channel connection to the array that is being
   upgraded is needed.
 
Unpack the patch into any convenient directory such as /var/tmp, and refer
to the Special Install Instructions below.

Special Install Instructions:
-----------------------------
 
*** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning ***
 
This firmware upgrade procedure will prevent StorEdge 3510 arrays from
servicing normal I/O requests for three to five minutes.  For this
reason, all StorEdge 3510 logical disks should be unmounted from any
Solaris hosts connected to the array for the duration of the install
procedure.
 
 
1. Download the patch from sunsolve to the /tmp directory.
3. ftp the 140815-01.tar.Z file to the /tmp directory in the machine used to monitor the system.
4. rlogin to the machine used to monitor the system.
5. Enter the commands:
6. cd /tmp
7. uncompress 140815-01.tar.Z
8. tar -xvf 140815-01.tar
9. cd 140815-01
10. pkgadd -d .
        (Add the 140815-01 package.)
 
 
11. Stop I/O to the StorEdge 3510 array.
 
12.  Use the SCCLI to verify the current controller firmware using the firmware
    application menu.  Choose "show inquiry-data".  If the
    firmware version reported is 3.27Q or later, this patch will work.
 
13.  Make certain to quiesce the SCSI bus to the minnow.
 
14.  Open a terminal window on the host that will be used to download the
    firmware.  Change your working directory, if necessary, to the
    directory in which the patch was unpacked and confirm that the
    ST336754L.062D.fw  file is present using the "ls" command.
 
15.  Type "./mload &lt;STOREdge3510 IP Address&gt;"  at the command prompt.
 
          mload responds with "Please Enter Hostname or IP Address Of 3xxx platform for upgrade:"
 
     Re-enter the IP &lt;STOREdge3510 IP Address&gt; of your STOREdge3510.
 
 
16.  Download new firmware to all disks at the same time by typing
        the following command at the prompt:
 
        download disk-firmware ST336754L.062D.fw "ST336754LSUN36G"
 
   You will receive the following warning. Answer it as below:
    WARNING: This is a potentially dangerous operation.
    The controller will go offline for several minutes.
    Data loss may occur if the controller is currently in use.
    Are you sure? y
    and then wait 4-5 minutes until the prompt appears again.
 
17.  Verify that the latest disk firmware is downloaded by choosing the
"show disks" command to view the DISK drive's firmware revision.

2. Procedure:
 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is
explained below. Upgrade time will be approximately 3 minutes per drive. 
 
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
        % su root
        # cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
        # tar xf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
 
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
        # ./download
 
c). Select the devices to be upgraded (see example below).
 
**NOTE**    Any device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
 
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  It is
            normal for the SCSI link to go offline for a few
            seconds and then return to the online state.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.
 
**NOTE**    For A3000/1000's, the internal disk "C" and "T" numbers
            are derived from the first active controller found.  The
            "D" number is encoded to indicate it's position using the
            following formula:  D = (tray_number * 100) + target_id.
 
d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
 
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
 
e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).
 
 
f). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit' (see example below).
