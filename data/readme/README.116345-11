    It has the supporting tool for updating the SPARC and/or SMC firmwares.
 
    Tool Name : FWupdate
 
    Purpose   : To initiate system firmware update (SPARCFW &amp; SMCFW) at Solaris
                level.
 
    User      : Must be Super User to execute this script
 
    Usage     : FWupdate [-h]
                FWupdate [-F] -f &lt;filepath&gt; -d &lt;device&gt; -t &lt;FW type&gt;
 
                -h : Help, show usage
                -F : To Force the update when the Firmware is being downgraded
                -f : Complete filepath &amp; filename specified by following 
                     argument
                -t : Type of Firmware binary.
                     Possible options={sparc, smc, sparc+smc}
                -d : Complete path of device node or device alias specifying
                     the device where file is located
                     If disk is specified, the file must be in the root
                     directory. Also, the file cannot of a Symbolic link
 
 
    Points of interest:
 
    1) The complete filepath &amp; filename must be specified using -f option.
    2) Use -d option to specify the device from which the file may be loaded.
       User may specify the device either using a OBP device alias or using the 
       complete path to the device node.
    3) If the file is located on a local disk then it must be in the root 
       directory and must not be a symbolic link.
    4) The tool performs a check on the version of SPARC Firmware. If a 
       downgrade is detected then the script would notify the user. A 
       downgrade can only be updated using the force (-F) option.
    5) Tool does not perform a check on SMCFW version.
    6) Update script FWupdate and info file FWupdate.info must be in same 
       directory.
 
 
    Sample usage:
 
    Example 1:
 
    FWupdate -f &lt;full_path&gt;/CP2140.SPARC.1.1.16_SMC.3.6.2 -d net -t sparc+smc
 
    File is located on the NFS and is combined OBP &amp; SMC image
 
 
    Example 2:
 
    FWupdate -f /CP2140.SPARC.1.1.16_SMC.3.6.2 -d disk -t sparc+smc
 
    File is on a local disk in root directory 
 
 
    Example 3:
 
    FWupdate -f /CP2140.SMC.3.6.2 -d disk -t smc
 
    File is SMC flash binary located on local disk
 
 
 
2. Install image from OBP 'ok' prompt:
--------------------------------------
 
The images for flash-update
 
	CP2140.SPARC.1.1.16_SMC.3.6.2	- Combined Sparc and SMC image 
	CP2140.SPARC.1.1.16		- Sparc image
	CP2140.SMC.3.6.2		- SMC image
	CP2140.SMC.BOOT.3F9.bin		- SMC boot image
 
 
 
o   From OS, do 'halt' and system will go to OBP 'ok' prompt.
 
o   Disable auto boot, if it is set to true.
 
	ok setenv auto-boot? false
 
 
o   Before flash-update the image, do 'reset-all' to reset the board.
 
 
o   Update image:
 
  *   Update Combined Sparc and SMC image
 
	ok flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2140.SPARC.1.1.16_SMC.3.6.2
 
 
  *   Update Sparc image
 
  	ok flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2140.SPARC.1.1.16
 
 
  *   Update SMC image
 
	ok smc-flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2140.SMC.3.6.2
 
 
  *   If the SMC boot image lost, it needs to do:
 
	ok smc-flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2140.SMC.BOOT.3F9.bin
 
 
o   After update Sparc only image, do 'reset-all' to reset the CP2140 board.
 
    Notice:
	After flash-update a combined image or a smc-flash-update SMC image,
	the CP2140 board will take a hardware reset as soon as the update 
	process is finished.
 
 
o   Set auto-boot? to true if it is needed.
 
	ok setenv auto-boot? true
 
 
3. Change memory bus speed
--------------------------
 
   There are two memory bus speed can set:
 
	High memory bus speed 108.00 MHz
	Low memory bus speed 092.57 MHz
 
 
   The ways to change memory bus speed:
 
   (1). Keyboard: 
 
	CTRL-L	-	setting memory bus speed low.
	CTRL-H	-	setting memory bus speed high.
 
        When power on or reset of the board, hold the keys 'Control' 
	and 'L' or 'H' down. 
 
	Note: The window of O+ board to pick up the key entry is short. 
	      Keep the keys down when power on or reset the board. 
 
   (2). OBP command:
 
	set-high-mem-speed	-	set memory to high bus speed
	set-low-mem-speed	-	set memory to low bus speed
	read-mem-speed		-	read nvram memory bus speed setting
 
	.speed			-	check system speeds
 
        After run those command, reset the board. 
 
 
   (3). Script:
 
	From os, run the script "MemSpeedUpdt" to set memory high and low.
 
        Reset the board to run the setting memory bus speed.	
 
 
    Note:
	a. The Double-wide memory is not supported at high memory bus speed. If user
    inadvertantly sets high bus speed on a board with double-wide memory, it may 
    hit a trap and not reach OBP 'ok' prompt. 
	Use keyboard command to reduce memory bus speed to low in this instance. 
 
	b. 2x512 MByte memory only runs low memory bus speed.
 
	c. When the diag-switch? is off, the window slot to catch the Ctrl-L 
    key entry is short. User can use Ctrl-D to turn on the diag-switch? then 
    use Ctrl-L to change memory bus speed.
