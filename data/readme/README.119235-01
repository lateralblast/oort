Patch Installation Instructions:
=============================
 
 
Intro
-----
 
    This README is intended for users who wish to upgrade the firmware
    in their Sun Blade 100 or Sun Blade 150 system Flash PROM.
 
Summary of the Patch Installation Process:
------------------------------------------
 
The installation shall comprise of the following steps
 
1)  Determine the system's current Flash PROM firmware revision.
 
2)  Compare the current Flash PROM firmware revision with the available or 
    latest Flash PROM firmware revisions.
 
3)  If the current Flash PROM firmware revision is lower than the latest
    available firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step. 
    If NOT, STOP: DO NOT CONTINUE.
 
4)  Prepare the system for the Flash PROM update
 
5)  Running the Flash PROM Utility
 
6)  Verifying successful Flash PROM Update
 
7)  Restoring the system
 
8)  Resume operations
 
 
Patch Installation instructions (in detail):
============================================
 
The required steps are explained in greater detail below.
 
1)  Determine the System's Current Firmware Revisions
    -------------------------------------------------
 
    While the OS is running the following command may be used to
    determine the current system firmware revisions;
 
        /usr/sbin/prtconf -V
        or
	/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/prtdiag -v | grep OBP
 
    The firmware revisions may also be determined from the PROM monitor's
    "ok" prompt with the following command;
 
	.version
 
2)  Compare the current Flash PROM firmware revision with the available or 
    latest Flash PROM firmware revisions.
 
    Compare the output of the OBP line in the "prtdiag -v" or "prtconf -V"
    output. Find the revision number and compare with the revision on the
    entries below that of the "flash-update-Blade100-Blade150-latest" line
 
      Available Firmware Revisions
      ----------------------------
 
flash-update-Blade100-Blade150-latest:
	OBP 4.17.1 2005/04/11 14:31
	 Sun (Grover) POST 2.0.1 05:13 PM on 08/23/01
	OBDIAG 4.17.1 2005/04/11 14:36  
 
flash-update-Blade100-Blade150-old:
	OBP 4.16.2 2004/10/04 18:21
	 Sun (Grover) POST 2.0.1 05:13 PM on 08/23/01
	OBDIAG 4.16.2 2004/10/04 18:23  
 
flash-update-Blade100-Blade150-older:
	OBP 4.15.7 2005/03/24 12:29
	 Sun (Grover) POST 2.0.1 05:13 PM on 08/23/01
	OBDIAG 4.15.7 2005/03/24 12:32  
 
3)  Is the UPGRADE NECESSARY?
 
    If the current Flash PROM revision matches the version numbers given under
    the flash-update-Blade100-Blade150-latest line, then STOP Here. This UPGRADE IS NOT
    NECESSARY.
 
    If the current Flash PROM firmware revision is lower than the latest
    firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step.
 
4) Preparing the System
   ---------------------
 
  a) As root, copy the latest "flash-update" files from the directory
     containing the patch to the root directory as follows:
 
     # cp flash*latest  /
     # chmod 755 /flash-update*
 
     In order to boot the binary, it must be located within the root
     partition.  If it is not already located within the root partition
     then move it to /.  If the binary is already located elsewhere 
     within the root partition then note the exact filepath so that the
     binary can be booted later.
 
  b) As root, exit the OS such that the system returns to the PROM's "ok"
     prompt: 
 
     # halt
 
       ok
 
  c) Power off the system.
 
** CAUTION **  Do not attempt to access any part of the system hardware
               with the system power still on!
 
  d) Remove the system top cover.  (If you are unsure how to do this then
     consult your system "Installation Guide" or "Service Manual".)
     Note: consult the enclosed flashprom-jumper-diagram.ps
 
  e) Set JP2 to write enable at 2+3. Default is write protect at 1+2
 
     Jumper JP2 provides a write enable/disable mechanism for the
     Flash PROM.  JP2 normally connects pins 1+2, which causes the
     Flash PROM to be write protected.  To enable patch installation,
     write enable the Flash PROM by MOVING the JP2 jumper from pins 1+2 
     to pins 2+3.
 
     **IMPORTANT NOTE**: If this jumper is NOT set to WRITE ENABLE, the 
     Flash update will fail.
 
     (If you have any difficulties consult the flashprom-jumper-diagram.ps
      file).
 
  f) Replace the system top cover.
 
 
5)  Running the Flash Update Utility
    --------------------------------
 
  a) Power on the system
 
     Wait for the PROM's banner to appear, and then
 
  b) Use the Stop-A keys (or Break key, if running from a serial line) to
     abort the auto-boot sequence.
 
     ** NOTE **  If the flash update completes normally then the values
     contained within the system's Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) configuration
     variables will be retained.  However, if the update process is some-
     how interrupted then it is possible that any non-default values
     contained in NVRAM will be lost.  For this reason it is recommended
     that you note down on paper the contents of any NVRAM configuration
     variable which has been customized so that they may be manually
     restored at a later time, if necessary.  (Use the PROM's "printenv"
     command to list the variables and their values.)
 
  c) The system should now display the PROM monitor's "ok" prompt.
     Now boot the Flash update utility as given below:
 
     CAUTION: Do not boot/run revisions lower than the latest unless you
	      are absolutely sure that that is what you want to do!
 
     ok boot disk /flash-update-Blade100-Blade150-latest
 
     NOTE: If your system's boot device is not "disk" then you will
           have to specify the appropriate devalias (e.g. disk2).
           If the binary is located in a location other than / then
           provide the entire filepath after the boot device.
 
     Answer the questions as prompted by the utility.

  key, if running from a serial line) to abort the auto-boot sequence
  if the system begins to boot.
 
6)  Verifying successful Flash PROM Update
 
    Verify from the results of the .version command that the OBP
    version matches the OBP version given above under the
    flash-update-Blade100-Blade150-latest entry in Step 2.
 
7)  Restoring the system
 
    The system should be restored to the original set-up as follows:
 
    a) Turn the power to the system off.
    b) Remove the top cover and move jumper JP2 to pins 1+2.
    c) Replace the top cover.
 
    If any problems should be encountered during the firmware upgrade
    then consult the "Sun Flash PROM Guide for Workstations and Workgroup
    Servers - Standalone Version".
 
8)  Resume operations
 
    a) Turn on the system power and allow the system to boot the
       operating system.
 
    b) Once the system has rebooted you may wish to remove the Flash Update
       binaries and documents since they will no longer be needed.
 
       # rm /flash-update*
 
    c) Remember to remove the files from their original location if
       they were not extracted directly into the root directory.
