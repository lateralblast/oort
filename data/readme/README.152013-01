**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.out" and "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 
1. Procedure:
 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is
explained below. Upgrade time will vary according to the system.
The approximate time to upgrade each disk is three minutes.
 
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
        % su root
        # cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
        # tar xf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
 
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
        # ./download
 
c). Select the devices to be upgraded (see example below).
 
**NOTE**    Any device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
 
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console 
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  It is
            normal for the SCSI link to go offline for a few
            seconds and then return to the online state.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.
 
**NOTE**    For A3000/1000's, the internal disk "C" and "T" numbers
            are derived from the first active controller found.  The
            "D" number is encoded to indicate it's position using the
            following formula:  D = (tray_number * 100) + target_id.
 
d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
 
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
 
e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).
 
f). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit' (see example below).
 
 
 
2 Linux JBOD env
    --------------
 
Linux_download or disktool.pl  for JBOD systems-
 
Note- See section e under 1.1 of procedure 1 to find out how to run disktool.pl 
 
Linux Download Example for OEL 6.4
 
Example -
[root@scsvr-183 ~]# ./nload -h
VER-1.01
Usage:   ./nload: [&lt;option&gt; &lt;device&gt; [fw_file]]
Option:  -i - single drive inquiry
         -d - download code to the drive
         -h - Usage...AK
         device - Use /dev/sgX as device, Where X hdd0 OR hdd1
                                          OR      sd0 OR sd1 ...
 
 
[root@scsvr-183 ~]# ./nload -d /dev/sg2  ./H101812SF.A770.fw
!!! Please wait downloading firmware ...!!!
Download Successful
    Inquiry for device &lt;/dev/sg2&gt; -
    SAS     HGSTH101812SFSUN1.2T           PQual: 0    Device_type: 0
 
 
 
3 Procedure to Download to Drives behind LSI Megaraid HBA 
    --------------------------------------------------------
A. Install the megaraid software for Linux or Solaris
B. the software will be install under /opt/MegaRAID directory
C. cd to this directory and one more level to the MegaCli directory
 
D. To Check start the download find out the
   Enclosure ID and the Slot ID for your drive by using this command
 
   ./MegaCli64 -PDList -aall
 
   You will get output something like this -
   Adapter #0
 
Enclosure Device ID: 9
Slot Number: 0
Device Id: 28
.
.
Inquiry Data: HGST H101812SFSUN1.2T A1600941K3T96E
FDE Capable: Not Capable
FDE Enable: Disable
.
.
 
E. Copy the f/w file in the same directory as the MegaCli64
     Run the bitops.sh  command as follows
     cd 152013-01/megaraid
     ./bitops.sh
     This will generate the firmware file H101812SF.A770.fw under megaraid directory
     of the patch use this file in step D
 
D. Run the download command to install one drive in slot 0
   under enclosure 9
   MegaCli64 -PdFwDownload -PhysDrv[9:0] -f /152013-01/megaraid/H101812SF.A770.fw -aALL
 
   For Multiple drives use the same command but with multiple drives
 
   MegaCli64 -PdFwDownload -PhysDrv[9:0,9:2,9:3,9:4,9:5] -f /152013-01/megaraid/H101812SF.A770.fw -aALL
