Patch Installation Instructions:
===============================
Please refer to the Install.info file for instructions on updating
the firmware using the files included in this patch.
 
Note:
=====
After the release of the first version of this patch (-01), a regression
was discovered that affects only certain configurations of the UltraSPARC
IIIi platforms using the first generation of PCI bus interface controller,
including the platform utilizing this patch release.  The problem may cause
a system to fail to boot if it has certain PCI cards installed in affected
PCI slots.  If this problem occurs, the system will display the following
error message on boot:
 
     ERROR: &lt;pci_device_path&gt;/&lt;Unnamed&gt;: Last Trap: Data Access Error
 
This is a known issue (CR 6890136) and is to be fixed in OBP 4.30.4.a.  For
systems that experience this issue, there are two workarounds.  Either move
the affected PCI card to a different slot, or downgrade your firmware to
the prior release until the -02 version of this patch is available.  Full
details on this issue are documented in CR 6890136.
 
                &gt;&gt;&gt; END &lt;&lt;&lt;
