Patch Installation Instructions:
-------------------------------- 
 This Patch has three disk drive Firmware Installer Utilities.  
 
 1. This patch includes firmware uploading utility (6120.sh) that 
 simplifies transferring the contents of this patch to a StorEdge
 6120 system. 
 2. This patch includes firmware installing utility (mload) that
 is required for installing drive firmware in SE3510 RAID enclosures.
 3. This patch includes firmware downloading utility (download) 
 that will upgrade or download code to drives in NON-RAID
 environment. 
 
 This script(s) are intended for use on Solaris host  systems only.  
 
***********************************************************************
 
 To install the contents of this Patch see the pertinent section below.

 B. SE6120 Installation Instructions
 C. SE3510 System Installation Instructions
 D. Non RAID System Installation Instructions
 
 
 
 A. **************** Initial Instructions************
 
 *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning ***
 BEFORE attempting to load firmware, be sure to stop all I/O 
 activity from all attached host systems. All necessary host 
 preparations needed to sustain this procedure should be made before 
 starting.
 
 
  To update the 6120 system or NON-T4 storage or systems with the 
  entire contents of this patch follow the steps below after 
  quiesc'ing I/Os from the host: 
 
 1. System Preparation
    -&gt;Once the patch has been downloaded to a Solaris host,
        change to the directory where the patch was downloaded.
        Next extract the patch. If you are extracting the signed
        patch, The jar file should be extracted using "unzip". 
    That way the permissions will be preserved. Similarly,
        if you are extracting the unsigned patch, you would need
        to use the tar utility. After the extraction process, the
        patch will be in directory format. You will be installing
        the package delivered by the patch using the pkgadd utility. 
 
        -&gt; Example: 
 
# pkgadd -d .

 iii. Transfer the contents of this patch to 6120 system 
 
    Note: There is limited space available in the 6120's reserved system 
          area.  Therefore, it is important to be sure there is 
          adequate space on the 6120 before proceeding with the 
          procedure to ftp firmware images to the unit.  It is
          not necessary to keep old images firmware, 
          on the 6120 once those images have been loaded.

   upgraded is needed.
 
Unpack the patch into any convenient directory such as /var/tmp, and refer
to the Special Install Instructions below.

Special Install Instructions:
----------------------------- 
 
*** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning ***
 
This firmware upgrade procedure will prevent StorEdge 3510 arrays from
servicing normal I/O requests for three to five minutes.  For this
reason, all StorEdge 3510 logical disks should be unmounted from any
Solaris hosts connected to the array for the duration of the install
procedure. 
1. Download the patch from sunsolve to the /tmp directory.
3. ftp the 116748-07.tar.Z file to the /tmp directory in the machine used to monitor the system.
4. rlogin to the machine used to monitor the system.
5. Enter the commands:
# cd /tmp
# uncompress 116748-07.tar.Z
# tar -xvf 116748-07.tar
# pkgadd -d .
 
	Add the 116748-07 package.
 
6. Stop I/O to the StorEdge 3510 array.
 
7.  Use the SCCLI to verify the current controller firmware using the firmware
    application menu.  Choose "View System Information".  If the
    firmware version reported is 3.27Q or later, this patch will work.
 
8.  Make certain to quiesce the FC bus to the minnow.
 
9.  Open a terminal window on the host that will be used to download the
    firmware.  Change your working directory, if necessary, to the
    directory in which the patch was unpacked and confirm that the
     ST336753F.0449.fw  file is present using the "ls" command.
 
10.  Type "./mload &lt;STOREdge3510 IP Address&gt;"  at the command prompt.  
 
	  mload responds with "Please Enter Hostname or IP Address Of 3xxx platform for upgrade:"
 
     Re-enter the IP &lt;STOREdge3510 IP Address&gt; of your STOREdge3510.
 
 
11.  Download new firmware to all disks at the same time by typing 
	the following command at the prompt:
 
        download disk-firmware ST336753F.0449.fw "ST336753FSUN36G"
 
   You will receive the following warning. Answer it as below:
    WARNING: This is a potentially dangerous operation.
    The controller will go offline for several minutes.
    Data loss may occur if the controller is currently in use.
    Are you sure? y
    and then wait 4-5 minutes until the prompt appears again.
 
12.  Verify that the latest disk firmware is downloaded by choosing the
"show disks" command to view the DISK drive's firmware revision.

2B. Installation instructions for downloading disk firmware to drives
    installed in a NON-6120/NON-T3/SE3510 JBOD system environment 
 
 
i. General installation instructions before proceeding download
 
 BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
 
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
 
        UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.
 
        UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
 
        REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
        volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
        not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
 
        UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
        the section below.
 
        In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the
        relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be
        that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen
        as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file
        being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.
 
**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting off the Solaris release CD.
 
**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligible for upgrade.
 
        RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.
 
**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.
 
ii. Change directory to patch location and run the download command
 
EXAMPLE:
--------
 
# cd /var/sadm/swimages/116748-07/
# ls
6120.sh            README.116748-07   download
DOWNLOAD           ST336753F.0449.fw  patchtoc
 
In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
        # ./download             -see example below-
 
**NOTE**    A device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
