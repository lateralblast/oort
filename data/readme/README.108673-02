Then reboot your system.
This image will replace the whole of the current system PROM image with the imag

custom dropins to your system PROM.

Special Install Instructions:

**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
*  PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND ENTIRELY.  PLEASE FOLLOW THE
   INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE STATED.
*  FAILURE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS COULD EITHER RESULT IN A DEFECTIVE BOARD OR

*  THIS IS NOT A STANDARD PATCH in that it does not use the installpatch
   and backoutpatch scripts.
*  THIS PATCH CANNOT BE INSTALLED ON AN ONLINE OPERATING SYSTEM BECAUSE

========================================================================
  Bug Fixes and Feature list added since 3.10.24.FCS
========================================================================
 1. Added Japanese to the cycle of languages for the PS/2 keyboard.
    NOTE : We are working on adding additional languages in the driver.
    Those will be in the future releases.
 2. Put back fix in ATI 3D rage pro code.This is to fix the problem
    in SunVTS test, add set-dimensions and support words. Bug id
    4275948 opened against topdog. 
 3. Add "resolution-handshake" property for m64 graphics card drivers
    to use in combination with set-dimensions to keep in sync with OS
    resolution. Bug id 4268670 opened against topdog.
 4. Mac Address Fix put in the main source. Now both the network
    interfaces will be assigned unique and successive addresses
    based on System mac address irrespective of whether it is
    EVEN or ODD. 
    How to test : 
    - Get a pair of serial eeproms that are used on Nordica,
      one programmed with ODD mac address and other with EVEN
      mac address.
    - Plug each of them on Nordica systems and verify that
      each of the network interfaces are assigned unique mac
      address. This can be verified by looking into the 
      properties of network device nodes.
    NOTE : It is the sole responsibility of the Operations to send out
    each system with a set of two mac addresses such that there
    is no conflict in Mac addreses between different systems.
 5. A code fix has been put in the IDE cdrom obp driver. This 
    fix was obtained from one of the customer. They had some
    time out issue with the cdrom interface on the
    secondary PCI bus. This fix has been tested by them on several 
    systems with various cds (bootable/non-bootable/audio/none)
    and it works in all situations. There is one issue with it 
    though. If there is no cd or an audio/damaged cd it will take
    20 seconds for boot cdrom to fail.If this delay becomes a issue,
    it can be solved with the help of a nvramrc patch or, a dropin.
    Please test the CDROM interface.
 6. DHCP protocol support added for network install of Solaris.
    Note that DHCP works with the Solaris 2.8 Install server only.
 7. Fix for Bug Id 4330294.
       Detail : tty BREAK character  does not work consistently.
 8. Code fix for "tpe-link-test?" w.r.t the Lucent Phy Lu6612. 
    This Phy chip is used on nordica-red as against National 
    Phy on nordica board. This fix was requested by one of the 
    OEM clients. On some networks it is needed that "tpe-link-test?"
    be set to false, so that the board does not do a link pulse test.
 9. SDRAM memory module support :
    The obp has support for SDRAM memory modules. The production version
    of SDRAM modules will be available much later. We may have
    SDRAM proto types in Operations, please get them and test 
    on Nordica-red/Nordica.
 10.Post fix for TI PCI bridge :
    There is a post bug fix for TI PCI bridge that are going to 
    be used interchangably in place of current Dec21150 bridge 
    chip on Nordica boards. Please get hold of board with TI bridge
    and verify POST in max mode.
 11. Post "menus" mode fix :
     The "menus" mode of "diag-level" in post is not a supported
     mode. In post1.17, diag-level = menus, defaults to "max" mode
     of operation.
 12. 2 ms delay added in the PCI reset of secondary bus to make the
     reset pulse width conform to PCI spec 2.1. This is internal to
     OBP.
 13. Based on  certain customer reports, there was anomaly found 
     in the way obp goes about initializing the latency timer 
     register for the PCI bus master device. After few rounds of
     discussion, it was decided that, this should be done at the
     Solaris level.
     To bring about this change, obp code is modified a bit . 
     The creation of "latency-timer" property under the bus master
     nodes has been removed. This enables Solaris to re-initialize
     the latency timer registers for all the PCI bus master devices.
