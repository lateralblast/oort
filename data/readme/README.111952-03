When the upgrade is complete, shut down and then power cycle the
system.  After the system has been rebooted, the unpacked patch may be
removed if desired.
 
After performing the above, the upgrade may be verified using one of
the following methods:
 
  1.  At OBP, use the '.version' command.  The firmware versions
      displayed should be:
 
        ok .version
        Firmware CORE Release 1.0.18 created 2002/5/23 18:22
        Release 4.0 Version 18 created 2002/05/23 18:22

        CORE 1.0.18 2002/05/23 18:22
        ok 
 
 
  2.  When running Unix, use the prtconf(1M) command.  The version
      displayed should be:
 
        # prtconf -V

   instructions exactly as stated.
 
*  Failure to follow the instructions could result in either a defective

   requires that the system be brought down.  Be sure to schedule down time to
   install this patch.
 
*  Any "Required" patches specified above must be installed on the system
   before performing the PROM upgrade.  If the patches are not installed,
   the upgraded system will not boot.
