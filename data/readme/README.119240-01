    available firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step. 
    If NOT, STOP: DO NOT CONTINUE.
 
4)  Prepare the system for the Flash PROM update
 
5)  Running the Flash PROM Utility
 
6)  Verifying successful Flash PROM Update
 
7)  Restoring the system
 
8)  Resume operations
 
 
Patch Installation instructions (in detail):
============================================
 
The required steps are explained in greater detail below.
 
1)  Determine the System's Current Firmware Revisions
    -------------------------------------------------
 
    While the OS is running the following command may be used to
    determine the current system firmware revisions;
 
        /usr/sbin/prtconf -V
        or
	/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/prtdiag -v | grep OBP
 
    The firmware revisions may also be determined from the PROM monitor's
    "ok" prompt with the following command;
 
	.version
 
2)  Compare the current Flash PROM firmware revision with the available or 
    latest Flash PROM firmware revisions.
 
    Compare the output of the OBP line in the "prtdiag -v" or "prtconf -V"
    output. Find the revision number and compare with the revision on the
    entries below that of the "flash-update-SunFire440-latest" line
 
      Available Firmware Revisions
      ----------------------------
 
flash-update-SunFire440-latest:
	OBP 4.16.6 2005/05/09 13:03 Sun Fire V440,Netra 440
	OBDIAG 4.16.6 2005/05/09 13:05  
	 Sun Fire[TM] V440,Netra[TM] 440 POST 4.16.5 2005/02/28 16:30 
 
flash-update-SunFire440-old:
	OBP 4.16.4 2004/12/18 05:20 Sun Fire V440,Netra 440
	OBDIAG 4.16.4 2004/12/18 05:21  
	 Sun Fire[TM] V440,Netra[TM] 440 POST 4.16.3 2004/11/05 20:05 
 
3)  Is the UPGRADE NECESSARY?
 
    If the current Flash PROM revision matches the version numbers given under
    the flash-update-SunFire440-latest line, then STOP Here. This UPGRADE IS NOT
    NECESSARY.
 
    If the current Flash PROM firmware revision is lower than the latest
    firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step.
 
4) Preparing the System
   ---------------------
 
  a) As root, copy the latest "flash-update" files from the directory
     containing the patch to the root directory as follows:
 
     # cp flash*latest  /
     # chmod 755 /flash-update*
 
     In order to boot the binary, it must be located within the root
     partition.  If it is not already located within the root partition
     then move it to /.  If the binary is already located elsewhere 
     within the root partition then note the exact filepath so that the
     binary can be booted later.
 
  b) As root, exit the OS such that the system returns to the PROM's "ok"
     prompt: 
 
     # halt
 
       ok
 
  c) Jumper J4205 is factory-set so that the flash PROM is write-enabled.
     There is no need to switch the jumper before flash updating; however,
     you must ensure that the keyswitch is in the Power-on or Diagnostics
     position.  When the key switch is in the locked position the flash
     PROM is write protected.
 
5)  Running the Flash Update Utility
    --------------------------------
     ** NOTE **  If the flash update completes normally then the values
     contained within the system's Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) configuration
     variables will be retained.  However, if the update process is some-
     how interrupted then it is possible that any non-default values
     contained in NVRAM will be lost.  For this reason it is recommended
     that you note down on paper the contents of any NVRAM configuration
     variable which has been customized so that they may be manually
     restored at a later time, if necessary.  (Use the PROM's "printenv"
     command to list the variables and their values.)
 
  a) The system should now display the PROM monitor's "ok" prompt.
     Now boot the Flash update utility as given below:
 
     CAUTION: Do not boot/run revisions lower than the latest unless you
	      are absolutely sure that that is what you want to do!
 
     ok boot disk /flash-update-SunFire440-latest
 
     NOTE: If your system's boot device is not "disk" then you will
           have to specify the appropriate devalias (e.g. disk2).
           If the binary is located in a location other than / then
           provide the entire filepath after the boot device.
 
     Answer the questions as prompted by the utility.

  Once the PROM's banner reappears then use the Stop-A keys (or Break
  key, if running from a serial line) to abort the auto-boot sequence
  if the system begins to boot.
 
6)  Verifying successful Flash PROM Update
 
    Verify from the results of the .version command that the OBP
    version matches the OBP version given above under the
    flash-update-SunFire440-latest entry in Step 2.
 
7)  Resume operations
 
    a) Allow the system to auto-boot, by issuing a "go" command or issue 
       the boot command for your environment.
 
    b) Once the system has rebooted you may wish to remove the Flash Update
       binaries and documents since they will no longer be needed.
 
       # rm /flash-update*
 
    c) Remember to remove the files from their original location if
       they were not extracted directly into the root directory.

Special Install Instructions:
----------------------------- 
 
  Note 1: If you have the frame buffer Raptor GFXP -04 REV 50
          (part 370-3753-04), you *must* install patch 110126-03 to upgrade the
          FCode in the card **BEFORE** you can do the firmware update. Revisions
          -05 and up of the frame buffer are not affected.
 
	  Failure to install the frame buffer patch (110126-03) will cause
          "FATAL" resets after the firmware update.
 
  Note 2: This utility is *not* OS-dependent.  The list of releases shown under
          the "Solaris Release" and "SunOS Release" sections may not be
          complete: The absence of a valid Solaris Release or SunOS  Release
          from the lists above does not preclude the installation of this patch
          against the hardware.
 
  Note 3: Modifications to Diagnostic Operation
 
          This released version of OpenBoot enables diagnostic execution for all
          power-on and error reset events, **as the new system default.
 
          **To implement this new policy, behavioral changes to diagnostic
          controls were made to simplify the enabling of diagnostics and
          controlling the level and verbosity of diagnostics.
 
          A new feature includes a Sun-prescribed mode of diagnostic execution,
          which overrides user-defined settings.  This mode provides service
          personnel with an easy method by which to invoke a predictable
          execution of diagnostics.
 
          The new standard (default) configuration will increase system boot
          time ( measured from power-on to the 'ok&gt;' prompt ) and messaging
          ( varies by system configuration ) for all 'power-on-reset' and OBP
          detected 'error-reset' events. Increased boot time and messaging is
          largely due to the execution of diagnostics.
 
          Automated System Recovery (ASR), a form of restoration, is implemented
          at the firmware layer and increases overall system availability when
          diagnostics are enabled.  
 
          For more specific details regarding these OBP changes, reference the
          pdf document; "OpenBoot[tm] PROM Enhancements for Diagnostic
 
** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING: ** WARNING **
 
*  PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND ENTIRELY.  PLEASE FOLLOW THE
   INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE STATED.
 
*  FAILURE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS COULD EITHER RESULT IN A DEFECTIVE BOARD OR
   UNSUCCESSFUL FLASH PROM UPDATE.
 
*  THIS IS NOT A STANDARD PATCH in that it does not use the installpatch
   and backoutpatch scripts.
 
*  THIS PATCH CANNOT BE INSTALLED ON AN ONLINE OPERATING SYSTEM BECAUSE
   THE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRES THAT THE SYSTEM BE BROUGHT DOWN.
   BE SURE TO SCHEDULE DOWN TIME TO INSTALL THIS PATCH.
 
*  Installation of the firmware included with this patch does NOT
   require any hardware changes if the Flash update completes normally. 
 
*  PLEASE REVIEW NOT ONLY THIS README BUT ALSO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
   GIVEN.
   The file "802-3233-xx.ps" (where xx stands for the latest numeric
   revision) is a PostScript copy of the "Sun Flash PROM Guide for Workstations
   and Workgroup Servers - Standalone Version", which  provides the following;
 
   (i) Emergency instructions in the unlikely event that the Flash
        update should fail.
 
   Note, however, that The Programming Guide was originally written for
   a user who is running the Flash PROM update utility from a bootable
   CDROM, and thus it will not contain the proper boot commands for
   installation of this patch.  Also note that the instructions in
   the document for installing packages are not valid for this patch.
