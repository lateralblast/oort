Watchdog Timer - Sun Fire Entry-Level Midrange Systems 5.19.0 - 7/29/2005
=========================================================================
 
 
This text gives information on the application mode of the watchdog
timer on the Netra 1280 server.
 
The enhancement allows users to:
 
o Configure the watchdog timer - User applications running on the host can 
configure and use the watchdog timer, enabling customers to detect fatal 
problems from their applications and to recover automatically.
 
o Program Alarm 3 - This enables users to generate this alarm in case of 
critical problems in their applications.
 
This README text provides the following sections to help you understand how to 
configure and use the watchdog timer and program Alarm3:
 
o Upgrading the Firmware Using the lom -G Command
o Understanding the Watchdog Timer Application Mode
o Using the ntwdt Driver
o Understanding the User APIs
o Setting the Time-out Period
o Enabling or Disabling the Watchdog
o Rearming ("Patting") the Watchdog
o Getting the State of the Watchdog Timer
o Finding and Defining Data Structures
o Using the Sample Watchdog Program
o Programming Alarm3
o Understanding Error Messages
o Knowing Unsupported Features and Limitations
 
 
 
Upgrading the Firmware Using the lom -G Command
-----------------------------------------------
 
** WARNING **
Both the RTOS and ScApp need to be updated before rebooting.
Ignore any reboot messages you may receive in between each update.
(Do not reset the SC between updating sgsc.flash and sgrtos.flash.
Go to step 2 after BOTH have been updated)
 
* See infodoc 81977 for typical system responses during the upgrade.
* It is best to have two sessions open
  - login to the system controller to watch progress
  - login to the system as root to run the commands
 
Before starting the upgrade, reset the system controller from the console.
This frees resources on the controller and places it in a known state prior
to the upgrade.
 
1) Reset the system controller from the console.
       lom&gt; resetsc -y
 
2) Upgrade the firmware on the system controller (SC):
 
       #lom -G sgrtos.flash
       #lom -G sgsc.flash
 
3) Escape to lom&gt; and reset the SC:
 
       lom&gt; resetsc -y
 
To get to the Lights Out Management (lom) prompt, you can telnet directly into 
the Ethernet port of the SC (this is different from the Solaris IP address), or 
you can attach a console to the serial port on the SC. If you are remote from 
the system, configure the SC's Ethernet port, or attach the SC serial port to a 
network terminal server.
 
4) Upgrade the firmware on the system boards:
 
       #lom -G lw8cpu.flash
       #lom -G lw8pci.flash
 
5) Shutdown the Solaris(TM) Operating System (OS).
 
6) Power off the system.
 
	lom poweroff
 
7) Power on the system.
 
	lom poweron
 
 
 
Understanding the Watchdog Timer Application Mode
-------------------------------------------------
 
 
The watchdog mechanism detects a system hang, or an application hang or crash, 
should they occur. The watchdog is a timer that is continually reset by a user 
application as long as the operating system and user application are running. 
 
When the application is rearming the application watchdog, an expiration can be 
caused by:
 
o Crash of the rearming application
o Hang or crash of the rearming thread in the application
o System hang
 
When the system watchdog is running, a system hang, or more specifically, the 
hang of the clock interrupt handler causes an expiration.
 
The system watchdog mode is the default. If the application watchdog is not 
initialized, then the system watchdog mode is used.
 
The "setupsc" command, an existing command on the SC Lights Out Management can 
be used to configure the recovery for the system watchdog ONLY:
 
lom&gt; setupsc
 
The system controller configuration should be as follows:
 
SC POST diag Level [off]:
Host Watchdog [enabled]:
Rocker Switch [enabled]:
Secure Mode [off]:
 
PROC RTUs installed: 0
PROC Headroom quantity (0 to disable, 4 MAX) [0]:
 
The recovery configuration for the application watchdog is set using 
Input/Output Control codes (IOCTLs) that are issued to the ntwdt driver.
 
 
 
Using the ntwdt Driver
----------------------
 
 
To use the new application watchdog feature, you must install the ntwdt 
driver. To enable and control the watchdog's application mode, you must 
program the watchdog system using the LOMIOCDOGxxx IOCTLs, described in the 
section "Understanding the User API".
 
If the ntwdt driver, as opposed to the system controller, initiates a reset of 
the Solaris OS on application watchdog expiration, the value of the following 
property in the ntwdt driver's configuration file (ntwdt.conf) is used:
 
ntwdt-boottimeout="600";
 
In case of a panic, or an expiration of the application watchdog, the ntwdt 
driver reprograms the watchdog time-out to the value specified in the property.
 
Assign a value representing a duration that is longer than the time it takes to 
reboot and perform a crash dump. If the specified value is not large enough, the 
SC resets the host if reset is enabled. Note that this reset by the SC occurs 
only once.
 
 
 
Understanding the User API
---------------------------
 
 
The ntwdt driver provides an application program interface by using IOCTLs. You 
must open the /dev/ntwdt device node before issuing the watchdog IOCTLs.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Only a single concurrent instance of open() is allowed on /dev/ntwdt. Any 
subsequent open() generates the following error message: EAGAIN - (The driver is
busy, try again.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
You can use the following IOCTLs with the watchdog timer:
 
o LOMIOCDOGTIME -  Set time-out period for watchdog timer 
o LOMIOCDOGCTL -   Enable or disable watchdog timer
o LOMIOCDOGPAT -   Rearm ("pat") watchdog timer
o LOMIOCDOGSTATE - Get state of watchdog timer
o LOMIOCALCTL -    Set value of Alarm3
o LOMIOCALSTATE -  Get state of Alarm3
 
 
 
Setting the Time-out Period
---------------------------
 
 
The LOMIOCDOGTIME IOCTL sets the time-out period of the watchdog. This IOCTL 
programs the watchdog hardware with the time specified in this IOCTL. You must 
set the time-out period (LOMIOCDOGTIME) before attempting to enable the watchdog 
timer (LOMIOCDOGCTL).
 
The argument is a pointer to an unsigned integer. This integer holds the
new time-out period for the watchdog in multiples of 1 second. You can 
specify any time-out period in the range of 1 second to 180 minutes.
 
If the watchdog function is enabled, the time-out period is immediately
reset so that the new value can take effect. An error (EINVAL) is displayed if 
the time-out period is less than 1 second or longer than 180 minutes.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The LOMIOCDOGTIME is not intended for general purpose use. Setting the
watchdog time-out to too low a value might cause the system to receive a
hardware reset if the watchdog and reset functions are enabled. If the
time-out is set too low, the user application must be run with a higher
priority (for example, as a real time thread) and must be rearmed more
often to avoid an unintentional expiration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
Enabling or Disabling the Watchdog
----------------------------------
 
 
The LOMIOCDOGCTL IOCTL enables or disables the watchdog, and it enables or 
disables the reset capability. (See the "Data Structures" section for the 
correct values for the watchdog timer.) 
 
The argument is a pointer to the lom_dogctl_t structure (described in
greater detail in the "Data Structures" section).
 
Use the reset_enable member to enable or disable the system reset function. 
Use the dog_enable member to enable or disable the watchdog function. An
error (EINVAL) is displayed if the watchdog is disabled and reset is
enabled.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If LOMIOCDOGTIME has not been issued to set up the time-out period prior 
to this IOCTL, the watchdog is NOT enabled in the hardware.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
Rearming, or Patting, the Watchdog
----------------------------------
 
 
The LOMIOCDOGPAT IOCTL rearms, or pats, the watchdog so that the watchdog starts 
ticking from the beginning; that is, to the value specified by LOMIOCDOGTIME. 
This IOCTL requires no arguments. If the watchdog is enabled, this IOCTL must be 
used at regular intervals that are less than the watchdog time-out, or the 
watchdog expires.
 
 
 
Getting the State of the Watchdog Timer
---------------------------------------
 
 
The LOMIOCDOGSTATE IOCTL gets the state of the watchdog and reset
functions and retrieves the current time-out period for the watchdog. If
LOMIOCDOGSTATE was never issued to set up the time-out period prior to
this IOCTL, the watchdog is not enabled in the hardware.
 
The argument is a pointer to the lom_dogstate_t structure (described in
greater detail in the section on "Data Structures"). The structure members
are used to hold the current states of the watchdog reset circuitry and
current watchdog time-out period. Note that this is not the time
remaining before the watchdog is triggered.
 
The LOMIOCDOGSTATE IOCTL requires only that open() be successfully called. This 
IOCTL can be run any number of times after open() is called, and it does not 
require any other DOG IOCTLs to have been executed.
 
 
 
Finding and Defining Data Structures
------------------------------------
 
 
All data structures and IOCTLs are defined in lom_io.h, which is available in 
the SUNWlomu package.
 
The data structures for the watchdog timer are shown here:
 
1. The watchdog/reset state data structure is as follows:
 
typedef struct { 
	int reset_enable; /* reset enabled if non-zero */ 
	int dog_enable; /* watchdog enabled if non-zero */ 
	uint_t dog_timeout; /* Current watchdog time-out in seconds */ 
} lom_dogstate_t; 
 
2. The watchdog/reset control data structure is as follows:
 
typedef struct { 
        int reset_enable; /* reset enabled if non-zero */ 
        int dog_enable; /* watchdog enabled if non-zero */ 
} lom_dogctl_t;
 
 
 
Using the Sample Watchdog Program
-----------------------------
 
 
Following is a sample program for the watchdog timer:
 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;lom_io.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
 
int
main()
{
        uint_t timeout = 30;
        lom_dogctl_t dogctl;
        int fd;
 
        dogctl.reset_enable = 1;
        dogctl.dog_enable = 1;
 
        fd = open("/dev/ntwdt", O_EXCL);
 
        /* Set timeout */
        ioctl(fd, LOMIOCDOGTIME, (void *)&amp;timeout);
 
        /* Enable watchdog */
        ioctl(fd, LOMIOCDOGCTL, (void *)&amp;dogctl);
 
 
        /* Keep patting */
        while (1) {
                ioctl(fd, LOMIOCDOGPAT, NULL);
                sleep (5);
        }
 
        return (0);
}
 
 
 
Programming Alarm3
------------------
 
 
Alarm3 is available to Solaris Operating System users irrespective of the 
watchdog mode. Alarm3 or system alarm ON and OFF have been redefined (see the 
table below.) 
 
 
Set the value of Alarm3 using the LOMIOCALCTL IOCTL. You can program Alarm3 like 
you set and clear Alarm1 and Alarm2.
 
The following table presents the behavior of Alarm3:
 
                            Alarm3        Relay       System LED (Green)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Poweroff                    ON          COM -&gt; NC    OFF
  Poweron/LOM up              ON          COM -&gt; NC    OFF
  Solaris running             OFF         COM -&gt; NO    ON  
  Solaris not running         ON          COM -&gt; NC    OFF
  Host WDT expires            ON          COM -&gt; NC    OFF
  User sets to ON             ON          COM -&gt; NC    OFF
  User sets to OFF            OFF         COM -&gt; NO    ON 
 
Alarm3 ON = Relay(COM-&gt;NC), System LED OFF
Alarm3 OFF = Relay(COM-&gt;NO), System LED ON
 
When programmed, you can check Alarm3 or the system alarm with the showalarm 
command and the argument "system".
 
For example:
 
sc&gt; showalarm system
system alarm is on
 
The data structure used with the LOMIOCALCTL and LOMIOCALSTATE IOCTLs is as 
follows:
 
#include &lt;lom_io.h&gt;
 
#define ALARM_NUM_1 1 
#define ALARM_NUM_2 2 
#define ALARM_NUM_3 3
 
#define ALARM_OFF 0 
#define ALARM_ON 1
 
typedef struct {
	int alarm_no; 
	int alarm_state;
} lom_aldata_t; 
 
 
 
Understanding Error Messages
----------------------------
 
 
Following are the error messages that might be displayed and what they mean:
 
 
EAGAIN 
 
This error message is displayed if you attempt to open more than one instance 
of open() on /dev/ntwdt.
 
 
EFAULT
 
This error message is displayed if an incorrect user-space address was
specified.
 
 
EINVAL 
 
This error message is displayed if a nonexistent control command
was requested or invalid parameters were supplied.
 
 
EINTR 
 
This error message is displayed if a thread awaiting a component state change 
is interrupted.
 
 
ENXIO 
 
This error message is displayed if the driver is not installed in
the system.
 
 
 
Knowing Unsupported Features and Limitations
--------------------------------------------
 
 
1) In the case of the watchdog timer expiration detected by the SC, the recovery 
is attempted only once; there are no further attempts of recovery if the first 
attempt fails to recover the domain.
 
 
2) If the application watchdog is enabled and you break into the OpenBoot(TM) 
PROM (OBP) by issuing the "break" command from the system controller's "lom" 
prompt, the SC automatically disables the watchdog timer.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The SC displays a console message as a reminder that the watchdog, from 
the SC's perspective, is disabled.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
However, when you reenter the Solaris OS, the watchdog timer is still ENABLED 
from the Solaris Operating System's perspective. To have both the SC and the Solaris OS view the same watchdog state, you must 
use the watchdog application to either enable or disable the watchdog.
 
3) If you perform a dynamic reconfiguration (DR) operation in which a system 
board containing kernel (permanent) memory is deleted, then you must 
disable the watchdog timer's application mode before the DR operation and 
enable it after the DR operation.  This is required because Solaris software 
quiesces all system IO and disables all interrupts during a memory-delete of
permanent memory. As a result, system controller firmware and Solaris software 
can not communicate during the DR operation. Note that this limitation affects 
neither the dynamic addition of memory nor the deletion of a board not 
containing permanent memory. In those cases, the watchdog timer's application 
mode can run concurrently with the DR implementation.
 
You can execute the following command to locate the system boards that contain 
kernel (permanent) memory:
 
sh&gt; cfgadm -lav | grep -i permanent
 
 
4) If the Solaris Operating System hangs under the following conditions, the 
system controller firmware cannot detect the Solaris software hang:
 
o Watchdog timer's application mode is set 
o Watchdog timer is not enabled 
o No rearming is done by the user
 
 
5) The watchdog timer provides partial boot monitoring. You can use the 
application watchdog to monitor a domain reboot.
 
However, domain booting is not monitored for:
 
o Bootup after a cold powerup
o Recovery of a hung or failed domain
 
In the latter cases, a boot failure is not detected and no recovery attempts are 
made.
 
 
6) The watchdog timer's application mode provides no monitoring for application 
startup. In application mode, if the application fails to start up, the failure 
is not detected and no recovery is provided.
