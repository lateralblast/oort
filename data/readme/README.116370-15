Installation Instructions:
 
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownnership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
5. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
6. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 This Patch has two disk drive Firmware Installer Utilities.
 
 1. This patch includes firmware installing utility (mload) that
 is required for installing drive firmware in SE3310 RAID enclosures.
 2. This patch includes firmware downloading utility (download)
 that will upgrade or download code to drives in JBOD and certain
 environments. These are the A1000, A3000 and A3500.
 
 This script(s) are intended for use on Solaris host  systems only.
 
***********************************************************************
 
 To install the contents of this patch see the pertinent section below.
 
 Sections Index
 A. SE3310 System Installation Instructions
 B. JBOD and Non-SE33xx RAID Systems Installation Instructions
 
 
*****************************************************************************
*****************************************************************************
 
A. ******************SE3310 System Installation Instructions ***************
 
  Note: For JBOD or Non-33xx Raid System Installation Instructions go to Section B.
 
   An Ethernet connection for the StorEdge
   3310, or two connections if dual controllers are installed, with an
   IP address assigned, allowing the user to connect to the array via
   telnet, or a serial connection supporting a tip(1) connection to the
   array.  Two network connections are required for dual-controller
   configurations.  Refer to the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family Installation,
   Operation, and Service Manual for the Sun StorEdge 3310 SCSI Array,
   section 5.4.1 for procedures to connect to the array via tip.  Refer
   to the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family Installation, Operation, and Service
   Manual for the Sun StorEdge 3310 SCSI Array, Appendix B, section B.2
   for procedures to connect to the array via telnet.
 
 
Unpack the patch into any convenient directory such as /var/tmp, and refer
to the Install Instructions below.

*** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning ***
 
This firmware upgrade procedure will prevent StorEdge 3310 arrays from
servicing normal I/O requests for three to five minutes.  For this
reason, all StorEdge 3310 logical disks should be unmounted from any
Solaris hosts connected to the array for the duration of the install
procedure.
 
1.FTP the .tar file to the machine used to monitor the system.
2.Then rlogin to the machine used to monitor the system.
3.Enter the command &gt;tar -xvf 116370-14.tar
4.cd  116370-14
5.Stop I/O to the StorEdge 3310 array.
 
6.  Determine the current controller firmware using the firmware
    application menu.  Choose "View System Information".  If the
    firmware version reported is 3.25Q or later, this patch will work.
 
 
7.  Make certain to quiesce the SCSI bus to the minnow.
 
8.  Open a terminal window on the host that will be used to download the
    firmware.  Change your working directory, if necessary, to the
    directory in which the patch was unpacked and confirm that the
    DK32EJ72N.PQ0F.fw  file is present using the "ls" command.
 
9.  Type "./mload"
  at the command prompt. 
  mload will respond with:
 
Please Enter HOSTNAME OR 
IP ADDRESS Of SE 3xxx for upgrade: 
 
Enter the name or the IP Address of your System and Return.
 
10. To determine what type of disk drives you have, at the prompt type:
 
		mdload&gt; show disks
 
You will get a response that looks something like this:

B.******* JBOD and Non-SE33xx RAID System Installation Instructions *********


Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 
1. General guidelines for upgrading: 
 
	BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
 
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
 
	UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.
 
	UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
 
	REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
	volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
	not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
 
	UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
	the procedure section below.
 
	In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the 
	relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be 
	that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen 
	as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file 
	being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.
 
**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting of the Solaris 2.10 release CD.
 
**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligible for upgrade.
 
	RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.
 
**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.

**NOTE**    This patch is for SUN SCSI JBOD and A3xxx series only
    		The patch CANNOT be downloaded if the drives are in a RAID
			environment EXCEPT for A1000, A3000 and A3500.
			Before installing this patch any and all Software AND OR
			Hardware RAID should be disabled EXCEPT for A1000, A3000 and A3500

 
 
 
2. Procedure: 
 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is
explained below. Upgrade time will vary according to the system.
The approximate time to upgrade each disk is three minutes.
 
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
	% su root
	# cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
	# tar xf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
 
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
	# ./download
 
c). Select the devices to be upgraded (see example below).
 
**NOTE**    Any device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
 
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console 
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  It is
            normal for the SCSI link to go offline for a few
            seconds and then return to the online state.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.
 
**NOTE**    For A3000/1000's, the internal disk "C" and "T" numbers
            are derived from the first active controller found.  The
            "D" number is encoded to indicate it's position using the
            following formula:  D = (tray_number * 100) + target_id.
 
d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
 
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
 
e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).
 
f). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit' (see example below).

**************************  WARNING  **************************
NO OTHER ACTIVITY IS ALLOWED DURING FIRMWARE UPGRADE!!!
No other programs including any volume manager (e.g. Veritas,
SDS, or Vold) should be running.  Other host systems sharing
any I/O bus with this host must either be offline or
disconnected.  Any interruption (e.g. power loss) during
upgrade can result in damage to devices being upgraded.

Any disk to be upgraded should first have its data backed up.
