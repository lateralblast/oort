By using Sun System Firmware (Firmware) you agree to the terms of the Software License Agreement and Entitlement (SLA/Entitlement) found in Sun_System_Firmware-6_4-download_SLA_and_Entitlement.txt.

Note:
This patch supports both the Sun Fire T1000 and now the APL SPARC Enterprise T1000 product lines, which share the same firmware.  We include two separate Sun System Firmware binary files, with different names corresponding to the respective products.   The different names are provided for convenience - the two files are otherwise identical.  For the Sun Fire T1000, upgrading to Sun System Firmware 6.4.6 (or later) requires Solaris 10 Update 1 (or later) to be installed. The system may experience boot or other problems with earlier version of Solaris (S10_HW2).  SPARC Enterprise T1000 (APL) configurations require Solaris 10 Update 3 (or later) to be installed.
