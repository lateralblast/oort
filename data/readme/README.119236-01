Patch Installation Instructions:
==============================
 
 
Intro
-----
 
    This README is intended for users who wish to upgrade the firmware
    in their Sun Blade 1500.  
 
 
Summary of the Patch Installation Process:
------------------------------------------
 
The installation shall comprise of the following steps
 
1)  Determine the system's current Flash PROM firmware revision.
 
2)  Compare the current Flash PROM firmware revision with the available or 
    latest Flash PROM firmware revisions.
 
3)  If the current Flash PROM firmware revision is lower than the latest
    available firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step. 
    If NOT, STOP: DO NOT CONTINUE.
 
4)  Prepare the system for the Flash PROM update
 
5)  Running the Flash PROM Utility
 
6)  Verifying successful Flash PROM Update
 
7)  Restoring the system
 
8)  Resume operations
 
 
Patch Installation instructions (in detail):
============================================
 
The required steps are explained in greater detail below.
 
1)  Determine the System's Current Firmware Revisions
    -------------------------------------------------
 
    While the OS is running the following command may be used to
    determine the current system firmware revisions;
 
        /usr/sbin/prtconf -V
        or
	/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/prtdiag -v | grep OBP
 
    The firmware revisions may also be determined from the PROM monitor's
    "ok" prompt with the following command;
 
	.version
 
2)  Compare the current Flash PROM firmware revision with the available or 
    latest Flash PROM firmware revisions.
 
    Compare the output of the OBP line in the "prtdiag -v" or "prtconf -V"
    output. Find the revision number and compare with the revision on the
    entries below that of the "flash-update-SunBlade1500-latest" line
 
      Available Firmware Revisions
      ----------------------------
flash-update-SunBlade1500-latest:
	OBP 4.17.1 2005/04/11 14:26 Sun Blade 1500
	 Sun Blade[TM] 1500 POST 4.17.1 2005/04/11 14:44 
	OBDIAG 4.17.1 2005/04/11 14:36  
 
flash-update-SunBlade1500-old:
	OBP 4.16.4 2004/12/18 05:20 Sun Blade 1500
	 Sun Blade[TM] 1500 POST 4.16.3 2004/11/05 20:18 
	OBDIAG 4.16.4 2004/12/18 05:21  
 
3)  Is the UPGRADE NECESSARY?
 
    If the current Flash PROM revision matches the version numbers given under
    the flash-update-SunBlade1500-latest line, then STOP Here. This UPGRADE IS NOT
    NECESSARY.
 
    If the current Flash PROM firmware revision is lower than the latest
    firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step.
 
4) Preparing the System
   ---------------------
 
  a) As root, copy the latest "flash-update" files from the directory
     containing the patch to the root directory as follows:
 
     # cp flash*latest  /
     # chmod 755 /flash-update*
 
     In order to boot the binary, it must be located within the root
     partition.  If it is not already located within the root partition
     then move it to /.  If the binary is already located elsewhere 
     within the root partition then note the exact filepath so that the
     binary can be booted later.
 
  b) As root, exit the OS such that the system returns to the PROM's "ok"
     prompt: 
 
     # init 0
 
       ok
 
 c) Jumper J27 is factory-set so that the flash PROM is write-enabled.
    There is no need to switch the jumper before flash updating.
 
 
5)  Running the Flash Update Utility
    --------------------------------
 
  a) Power on the system
 
     Wait for the PROM's banner to appear, and then
 
  b) Use the Stop-A keys (or Break key, if running from a serial line) to
     abort the auto-boot sequence.
 
     ** NOTE **  If the flash update completes normally then the values
     contained within the system's Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) configuration
     variables will be retained.  However, if the update process is some-
     how interrupted then it is possible that any non-default values
     contained in NVRAM will be lost.  For this reason it is recommended
     that you note down on paper the contents of any NVRAM configuration
     variable which has been customized so that they may be manually
     restored at a later time, if necessary.  (Use the PROM's "printenv"
     command to list the variables and their values.)
 
  c) The system should now display the PROM monitor's "ok" prompt.
     Now boot the Flash update utility as given below:
 
     CAUTION: Do not boot/run revisions lower than the latest unless you
	      are absolutely sure that that is what you want to do!
 
     ok boot disk /flash-update-SunBlade1500-latest
 
     NOTE: If your system's boot device is not "disk" then you will
           have to specify the appropriate devalias (e.g. disk2).
           If the binary is located in a location other than / then
           provide the entire filepath after the boot device.
 
     Answer the questions as prompted by the utility.

6)  Verifying successful Flash PROM Update
 
    Verify from the results of the .version command that the OBP
    version matches the OBP version given above under the
    flash-update-SunBlade1500-latest entry in Step 2.
 
7)  Resume operations
 
    a) Allow the system to auto-boot, or issue the boot command for your
       environment as necessary.
 
    b) Once the system has rebooted you may wish to remove the Flash Update
       binaries and documents since they will no longer be needed.
 
       # rm /flash-update*
 
    c) Remember to remove the files from their original location if
       they were not extracted directly into the root directory.

Special Install Instructions:
----------------------------- 
 
  NOTE 1: If you have the frame buffer Raptor GFXP -04 REV 50
          (part 370-3753-04), you *must* install patch 110126-03 to
          upgrade the FCode in the card **BEFORE** you can do the
          firmware update. Revisions -05 and up of the frame buffer
          are not affected.
 
          Failure to install the frame buffer patch (110126-03)
          will cause "FATAL" resets after the firmware update.
 
 
  NOTE 2: This utility (flash-update) is *not* OS-dependent.  The list of
          releases shown under the "Solaris Release" and "SunOS Release"
          are not inclusive  of all the SunOS releases that are compatible.
          The absence of a valid Solaris Release or SunOS  Release from
          the lists above does not preclude the installation of this patch
          against the hardware.
 
  NOTE 3: DIMMs Support
 
          OBP 4.9.4 is only compatible with DIMMs using SPD version 0.0.
          If you wish to install DIMMs with SPD version 1.x, you must first
          upgrade your OBP to 4.9.5 or higher, then install the DIMMs.
 
          If you do not upgrade your OBP prior to installing these DIMMs, OBP
          will beep 3 times and power off.  The following message will be
          printed to the serial port:
 
          "SPD reports DIMM has unsupported SPD revision
           System configuration failed, powering off"
 
          For compatible DIMM part numbers, please refer to the Sun Blade 1500
          Product Notes, or refer to the Special Install Instructions below.
 
  Note 4: Modifications to Diagnostic Operation     
 
          This released version of OpenBoot provides the ability to enable
          diagnostic execution for all power-on, user reset and error reset
          events **.  The default values of these configuration variables
          disable diagnostic execution at power-on, which is the same behavior
          as the previous OpenBoot patch.
 
          **To implement this new policy, behavioral changes to diagnostic
          controls were made to simplify the enabling of diagnostics and
          controlling the level and verbosity of diagnostics.
 
          A new feature includes a Sun-prescribed mode of diagnostic execution,
          which overrides user-defined settings.  This mode provides service
          personnel with an easy method by which to invoke a predictable
          execution of diagnostics.
 
          Enabling diagnostic execution at power-on will increase system boot
          time ( measured from power-on to the 'ok&gt;' prompt ) and messaging
          ( varies by system configuration ) for all 'power-on-reset' and OBP
          detected 'error-reset' events. Increased boot time and messaging is
          largely due to the execution of diagnostics.
 
          Automated System Recovery (ASR), a form of restoration, is implemented
          at the firmware layer and increases overall system availability when
          diagnostics are enabled.
 
          For more specific details regarding these OBP changes, reference the
          pdf document; "OpenBoot[tm] PROM Enhancements for Diagnostic
          Operation", included within this patch ( part 817-6957, July 2004).
