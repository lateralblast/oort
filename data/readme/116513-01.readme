<b>Patch Installation Instructions:</b><br>

<pre>-------------------------------- 
1. General guidelines for upgrading:

        Previous firmware versions which are upgradable to this level:

                        0604 0704

        BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.

        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.

        UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.

        UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.

        REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
        volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
        not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.

        UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
        the procedure section below.

        In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the
        relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be
        that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen
        as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file
        being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.

**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting off the Solaris 2.6 release CD.

**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligible for upgrade.

        RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.

**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.

2. Procedure:

The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is explained
below. Upgrade time will be approximately 5 minutes for the system above
Solaris 2.4.  For Solaris 2.4 and 2.3, the upgrade cycle will be 30
Seconds per disk.

a) Copy patch 116513-01 to a directory, say /usr/tmp.
   cd /usr/tmp   
   Unpack the patch if is is tar file.  
   To install the patch: do
        # pkgadd -d . PKG        -see example below-

b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
        # ./download             -see example below-

c). Enter the appropriate devices to be upgraded.  You can upgrade
    a single device, a group of devices, or all devices at once.

** See the example below**.

**NOTE**    A device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!

**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.

d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.

**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!

e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).

f). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit'.

**************************  WARNING  **************************
NO OTHER ACTIVITY IS ALLOWED DURING FIRMWARE UPGRADE!!!
No other programs including any volume manager (e.g. Veritas,
SDS, or Vold) should be running.  Other host systems sharing
any I/O bus with this host must either be offline or
disconnected.  Any interruption (e.g. power loss) during
upgrade can result in damage to devices being upgraded.

Any disk to be upgraded should first have its data backed up.
