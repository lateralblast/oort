Problem Description:

**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, or Vold must be idle and
   any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close accounting
   bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must reboot the
   system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.  The accouting
   bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring sole ownnership
   of the disk so it will not be eligable for upgrade.
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline.
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   For example, loss of power during download will result in damaged
   peripherals and require replacement.
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis.
3. This package will only function on Sun ST32550 disks.
4. This package is intended to be installed on SSA''s with 3.12 revision
   controller firmware.  Controller revisions 3.9 and 3.11 are not
   compatible with this package.
5. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
6. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
1. SPECIAL NOTE:
        PLEASE INSTALL THE REQUIRED PATCHES PRIOR TO RUNNING THE
        DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE. ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL
        (AFTER REBOOTING) WITH THE APPLIED PATCHES BEFORE ATTEMPTING
        TO RUN THE DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE.
        IF AND ONLY IF THE REQUIRED PATCHES ARE NOT RELEASED,
        (for ex  possibly the Solaris 2.3 patches 103351-01,
        following ONLY for Solaris 2.3 configurations:
        A) *BEFORE* downloading the disk firmware,
              For Solaris 2.3
                % su root
                # mv /kernel/drv/pln /pln.save
                # cp pln-2.3 /kernel/drv/pln
                # reboot
        B)  *AFTER* downloading the firmware,
             undo the above operation as follows:
                # mv /pln.save /kernel/drv/pln
                # reboot
2. General guidelines for upgrading: 
	Previous firmware versions which are upgradable to this level:
            0412
            0416
            0418
	BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
	UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligable for
        upgrade.
        UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
        REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
        volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
        not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
        UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
        the procedure section below.
	In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the 
	relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be 
	that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen 
	as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file 
	being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.
**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting of the Solaris 2.6 release CD.
**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligable for upgrade.
        RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.
**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.
3. Procedure: 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is
explained below. Upgrade time will be approximately 2 minutes
for the system above Solaris 2.4.  For Solaris 2.4 and 2.3,
the upgrade cycle will be 30 Seconds per disk.
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
	% su root
	# cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
	# tar xf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
	# ./download
c). Select the devices to be upgraded.
** See the examples below**.
**NOTE**    A device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console 
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  It is
            normal for the soc to go offline for a few seconds
            and then return to the online state.  The disk mode pages
            will also be restored to the default values.
d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type ''inquiry'' (see example below).
f). Quit the "download" program by typing ''quit''.

Firmware Download Utility, V2.50
**************************  WARNING  *************************
NO OTHER ACTIVITY IS ALLOWED DURING FIRMWARE UPGRADE!!!
No other programs including any volume manager (e.g. Veritas,
SDS, or Vold) should be running.  Other host systems sharing
any I/O bus with this host must either be offline or
disconnected.  Any interruption (e.g. power loss) during
upgrade can result in damage to devices being upgraded.
Any disk to be upgraded should first have it''s data backed up.
