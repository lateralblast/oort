Installation Instructions:
 
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownnership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
5. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
6. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.
 
7. To download the boot disk you must be in "single-user mode". To enter
   "single-user mode" reboot with the command:
   # reboot -- -s

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 
1. General guidelines for upgrading:
 
        BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
 
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
 
        UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.
 
        UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
 
        REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
        volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
        not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
 
        UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
        the procedure section below.
 
        In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the
        relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be
        that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen
        as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file
        being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.
 
**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting of the Solaris 2.6 release CD. Please be
                         advised that you cannot see the ultra3 scsi card with solaris 2.10 media.
            You also cannot use rm6 from the solaris 2.10 media and there are other
                         circumstances under which 2.6 is not usefull. But it will work in many cases.
 
**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "reboot - -s, or boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligible for upgrade.
 
        RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.
**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.
 
2. Procedure:
 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is
explained below. Upgrade time will be approximately 3 minutes per drive. 
 
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
        % su root
        # cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
        # tar -xvf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
 
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
        # ./download
 
c). Select the devices to be upgraded (see example below).
 
**NOTE**    Any device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
 
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  It is
            normal for the SCSI link to go offline for a few
            seconds and then return to the online state.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.
 
c). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
 
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
 
d). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).
 
 
e). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit' (see example below).
 
f) If this fails use the alternate method below:
 
./fwupd64x4500 /dev/rdsk/c0t29dos2? firmware/st95000ns.sf04.fw

**************************  WARNING  **************************
NO OTHER ACTIVITY IS ALLOWED DURING FIRMWARE UPGRADE!!!
No other programs including any volume manager (e.g. Veritas,
SDS, or Vold) should be running.  Other host systems sharing
any I/O bus with this host must either be offline or
disconnected.  Any interruption (e.g. power loss) during
upgrade can result in damage to devices being upgraded.
 
Any disk to be upgraded should first have its data backed up.
