        ok
 
  2.  When running Unix, use the prtconf(1M) command.  The version
      displayed should be:

*  Please read the instructions carefully and completely.  Please follow the
   instructions exactly as stated.
 
*  Failure to follow the instructions could result in either a defective
   system board or an unsuccessful flash PROM update.
 
*  This patch cannot be installed on a running system because the installation
   requires that the system be brought down.  Be sure to schedule down time to
   install this patch.
 
*  Any "Required" patches specified above must be installed on the system
   before performing the PROM upgrade.  If the patches are not installed,
   the upgraded system will not boot.
 
*  The upgrade will replace the whole of the current system PROM image
   with the new image provided in this patch.  Do not perform the upgrade
   if you have added custom dropins to the system PROM.
