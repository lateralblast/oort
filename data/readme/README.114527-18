Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
Please refer to the Install.info file for instructions on updating
the firmware using the files included in this patch.
 
Special Instructions:
Checksums of the FW images can be viewed near the bottom of this README.
 
(for Installing Patches on Sun Fire E2900, V1280, Netra 1280, and Netra 1290 Systems)
---------------------
 
Upgrading the Firmware Using the lom -G Command
-----------------------------------------------
 
** WARNING **
Both the RTOS and ScApp need to be updated before rebooting.
Ignore any reboot messages you may receive in between each update.
(Do not reset the SC between updating sgsc.flash and sgrtos.flash.
Go to step 2 after BOTH have been updated)
 
* See infodoc 81977 for typical system responses during the upgrade.
* It is best to have two sessions open
  - login to the system controller to watch progress
  - login to the system as root to run the commands
 
Before starting the upgrade, reset the system controller from the console.
This frees resources on the controller and places it in a known state prior
to the upgrade.
 
1) Reset the system controller from the console.
       lom&gt; resetsc -y
 
2) Upgrade the firmware on the system controller (SC):
 
       #lom -G sgrtos.flash
       #lom -G sgsc.flash
 
3) Escape to lom&gt; and reset the SC:
 
       lom&gt; resetsc -y
 
To get to the Lights Out Management (lom) prompt, you can telnet directly into 
the Ethernet port of the SC (this is different from the Solaris IP address), or 
you can attach a console to the serial port on the SC. If you are remote from 
the system, configure the SC's Ethernet port, or attach the SC serial port to a 
network terminal server.
 
4) Upgrade the firmware on the system boards:
 
       #lom -G lw8cpu.flash
       #lom -G lw8pci.flash
 
5) Shutdown the Solaris(TM) Operating System (OS).
 
6) Power off the system.
 
	lom poweroff
 
7) Power on the system.
 
	lom poweron
