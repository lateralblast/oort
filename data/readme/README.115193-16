Problem Description:

6282045 There should be one common OBP to boot Solaris 8 and Solaris 9U6 and higher
6241706 Snowbird  missing the SMC configuration values
6252373 get-device-sdr command should return FFFF for last record.
6252364 get-device-id command does not show that device SDRs are supported even though they are supported.

    It has the supporting tool for updating the SPARC and/or SMC firmwares.
 
 
    Tool Name : FWupdate
 
    Purpose   : To initiate system firmware update (SPARCFW &amp; SMCFW) from
                Solaris, to be performed at OBP or Solaris level.
 
    User      : Must be Super User to execute this script
 
    Usage     : FWupdate [-h]
                FWupdate [-F] -f &lt;filepath&gt; -d &lt;device&gt; -t &lt;FW type&gt;
                FWupdate [-F] [-s] -f &lt;filepath&gt; -t &lt;FW type&gt;
 
                -h : Help, show usage
                -s : Update firmware from Solaris environment
                -F : To Force the update when the Firmware is being downgraded
                -f : Complete filepath &amp; filename specified by following
                     argument
                -t : Type of Firmware binary.
                     Possible options={sparc, smc, sparc+smc}
                -d : Complete path of device node or device alias specifying
                     the device where file is located
                     If disk is specified, the file must be in the root
                     directory. Also, the file cannot of a Symbolic link
 
 
    Points of interest:
 
    1) The complete filepath &amp; filename must be specified using -f option.
    2) Use -d option to specify the device from which the file may be loaded.
       User may specify the device either using a OBP device alias or using the
       complete path to the device node.
    3) When updating from OBP level, if the file is located on a local disk
       then it must be in the root directory and must not be a symbolic link.
    4) The tool performs a check on the version of SPARC Firmware. If a
       downgrade is detected then the script would notify the user. A 
       downgrade can only be updated using the force (-F) option.
    5) Tool does not perform a check on SMCFW version.
    6) Update script FWupdate and info file FWupdate.info must be in same
       directory.
    7) User must reboot the system after updating the SPARC and/or SMC firmware
       through Solaris environment as SMC related functionality may not be
       available.
 
 
    Sample usage:
 
 
    Example 1:
 
    ./FWupdate -f &lt;full_path&gt;/CP2300.SPARC.1.0.23_SMC.4.1.12 -d net -t sparc+smc
 
    File is accessible from the TFTP boot server and is combined
    OBP &amp; SMC image
 
For example 2 and 3, make sure the binary file is in the root directory
of the disk.  The example is for a PMC disk in slot A.  If the PMC disk
is in slot B, then use "pmc1/disk" instead of "pmc0/disk". 
 
    Example 2:
 
    ./FWupdate -f /CP2300.SPARC.1.0.23_SMC.4.1.12 -d pmc0/disk -t sparc+smc
 
    File is on a local disk in root directory
 
 
    Example 3:
 
    ./FWupdate -f /CP2300.SMC.4.1.12.FLASH -d pmc0/disk -t smc
 
    File is SMC flash binary located on local disk
 
    Example 4:
 
    ./FWupdate -s -f /CP2300.SPARC.1.0.23_SMC.4.1.12 -t sparc+smc
 
    To update SPARC and SMC Firmware from Solaris environment. It is
    the users' responsbility to reboot the system to make new version
    effective.
 
    Example 5:
 
    ./FWupdate -s -f /CP2300.SPARC.1.0.23.FLASH -t sparc
 
    To update SPARC Firmware from Solaris environment. It is the users'
    responsbility to reboot the system to make new version effective.
 
 
    Example 6:
 
    ./FWupdate -s -f /CP2300.SMC.4.1.12.FLASH -t smc
 
    To update SMC Firmware from Solaris environment. It is the users'
    responsbility to reboot the system to make new version effective.
