Topic: Solstice DiskSuite 4.1_x86: Product patch
	NOTE 1: SDS4.1 and subsequent patches changed the permission of
                /etc to 775.  Please change the permissions on /etc
                appropriately before applying the patch.
	NOTE 2: This patch enables Solstice DiskSuite to support
                Alternate Pathing (AP).  AP provides fault recovery
                associated with disk and network adapter failure.
                For information on the use of AP, refer to the
                following documentation:
                Alternate Pathing 2.0 User's Guide      (805-0082-10)
                Alternate Pathing 2.0 Reference Manual  (805-0083-10)

(from 104173-05)
 
4043506 - mirror_map_write() overwrites label on x86 during metareplace of mirror component
 
4045398 - ODS syncing devices will cause a read to hang
 
1258389 - on metasync -p failure, EQ_REGEN_DONE event returned instead of EQ_REGEN_FAILED

(from 104173-04)
 
4041484 - system panics during ha-switch due to mirror_mark_resync_region
 
(from 104173-03)
 
4019273 - mirror not synchronizing properly with ODS 3.0 or ODS 4.0
 
        In some circumstances, when an application is modifying pages
        as they are being written, submirrors may momentarily contain
        different copies of data. This fix narrows this window to a
        much smaller time.
 
4023536 - RAID5 needs to set 4 bytes alignment for write buffer
 
4028959 - Incorrect size indicators are shown on Disk Information window.
 
(from 104173-02)
 
4004412 - add disk to diskset w/ stale dbases wipes out any existing
	  configuration
 
4004551 - taking set with 2 of 3 replicas bad &amp; mediators, returns 50/50
	  instead of stale
 
4005380 - loading a module when dbase is stale panics the machine
 
4004668 - release then take of diskset with mediators and tagged replicas
	  clears replicas
 
4005880 - metaset -q shows and metaset -t -u accepts tags that are no
	  longer available
 
4006305 - fully qualified non-existent slice results in core dump,
	  eg. /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s44
 
1247309 - metaset takes a long time to take a set when a disk in an ssa
	  is down
 
4012852 - inability to update at least 50% of mediators results in a panic
	  on take owner
 
4012858 - SUNWmdm cannot be upgraded using standard pkgrm/pkgadd procedures
 
4013095 - metaset(1M) does not always balance replicas properly on dual
	  string configs
 
4015009 - cannot forcible delete of a host and of a mediator host (host
	  repair procedure)
 
4016074 - metaset take ownership takes too long w/ unreachable mediator host
 
4013260 - specifying diskset name prefix with device name stopped working;
	  must use -s
 
4016847 - metadb -s-a fails when mediators are installed and second cluster
	  host is down
 
4016077 - medstat(1M) takes too long w/ an unreachable mediator
 
1204367 - Customers request ability to perform resync at disk speed
 
1265579 - RAID-5 under extreme loads hangs for 10,000 seconds
 
4004441 - Mirror and Stripe xcall performance slower on 2.6 than on 2.51
 
1250238 - libconfig doesn't return storage descriptors for all disks in a set
 
4022285 - metaset -s -t -f will allow takeover of string with stale data
	  with no error
 
(from 104173-01)
 
4007392 - (i18n) metatool hangs when select Exit on the File menu.
 
	  1) launch metatool under ja locale with both metatool.cat and
	     Metatool for ja.
	  2) select File -&gt; Exit
	  3) metatool hangs
 
4007398 - (i18n) Some items for Statistics Graph does not shown properly
	  in ja locale.
 
	  "Wait Queue", "15 Minute History (5 second intervals", "Totals",
	  "Reads", "Writes" and "Load" are not shown properly in ja locale.
 
	  The value for the divisions of the right scale of the graph does
	  not show properly. It seems that the value is 0.0001, but it
	  could not be shown.
 
	  The value for the divisions of the left scale of the graph might
	  have same problem as above.
 
4007403 - (i18n) "Size" of "Disk Information" is not correctly i18ned.
 
	  The "Size" option menu in the Disk Information window is not
	  i18n'ed correctly.
 
4007037 - (i18n) missing messages for metatool.
 
	  "Tools" and it's menu items of metatool of SDS4.1 are not
	  i18n'ed.
 
4010514 - (i18n) some OK seems to be hard coded.
 
	  The OK button labels are hard coded in some places.
 
4013935 - "On Help..." does not show correct help messages
 
	  The Help window, which comes up when selecting the "On help..."
	  from the "Help" of DiskSuite tools (metatool, and so on),
	  does not show the correct help message.
 
4014398 - %s shows up in several error dialogs
 
	  The error dialogs for some SSA operations have a %s in them
	  that's not filled in by the object that the error occurs upon.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
Refer to the Install.info file for instructions on using the
generic 'installpatch' and 'backoutpatch' scripts provided with
each patch.  Any other special or non-generic installation
instructions should be described below as special instructions.

Special Install Instructions:
-----------------------------
 
Reboot the system after patch installation.
 
The only caveat when using AP with Solstice DiskSuite is that you
must specify the full pathname when using AP with a DiskSuite
command.  For instance:
 
  # metahs -a hsp001 /dev/ap/dsk/mc3t0d0s2
 
The differences are the use of the "ap" directory in the path
and the addition of the "m" in front of the device name.
 
It is not necessary to specify the full pathname when using the
metatool graphical user interface.  Metatool finds the appropriate
path.
 
NOTE:   To get the complete fix for 4125102 (ufs_itrunc()/top_end_async()
        deadlock), make sure to install the kernel update patch on your
        system.  Here are the kernel update patch versions that have
        the fix for 4125102:
 
        Solaris 2.4 i386        101946-55 (or newer)
        Solaris 2.5 i386        103094-22 (or newer)
        Solaris 2.5.1 i386      103640-29 (or newer)
        Solaris 2.6 i386        105182-17 (or newer)
	Solaris 7 i386		106542-07 (or newer)
