Problem Description:

This patch corrects a code issue with 112(x)/AA2(x) fw that caused the first command to be 
processed in the drive with queue depth = 0 to take too long to process. This would slow
down I/O performance up to 3 times in some applications.
 
This patch is designed to download a special firmware for Seagate Cheetah4 FC-AL Drives.
This new firmware enables the Cheetah4 FC-AL Drive to exercise the flashROM and SRAM 
devices within the drive to prevent possible damage due to excessive periods of inactivity. 
The firmware also provides the ability to determine the flashROM vendor (requires an 
external, host-based utility included with this patch). This patch also contains utilities
which will "exercise" disk drives attached to the target host (also known as a "healthcheck")
and which will automatically download the new firmware to only the selected drives.
 
Code Change List:
 
1. Reduces command response time when queue depth = 0.
 
2. Changes time when drive idle exercize routine is invoked from 16ms to 100 ms.
 
3. Does not invoke drive idle exercise routine at all if Atmel FlashROM not installed.
 
The  patch has the following bug fixes :
