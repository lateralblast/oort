Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
This is not an OS patch and is not installed with the standard
patchadd(1M) command.  After unpacking the patch, follow the "Special
Install Instructions" below to upgrade the system PROM.
 
This patch is not OS-dependent.  The list of releases shown under the
"Solaris Release" and "SunOS Release" sections may not be complete.
The absence of the running Solaris Release or SunOS Release from the
lists above does not preclude the installation of this patch on the
hardware.

Special Install Instructions:
-----------------------------
The Solaris System Firmware update utility provides the ability to update the 
system firmware from Solaris. 
 
If you would like to update your system using the Solaris System Firmware
update utility please follow the instructions below:
 
*  PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND ENTIRELY.  PLEASE FOLLOW THE
   INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE STATED.
 
*  Failure to follow instructions could either result in a defective board or
   unsuccessful flash prom update.
 
*  Installation of the firmware included with this patch does NOT
   require any hardware changes if the Flash update completes normally.
 
*  IF THIS PATCH COMPLETES SUCCESSFULLY IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY ATTEMPT TO
   REBOOT THE OPERATING SYSTEM.
 
 
1.  Check the current version of the OBP firmware
 
    From the Solaris prompt type:
 
        # /usr/sbin/prtconf -V
	OBP 4.11.3 2003/07/11 13:30
 
    The firmware revisions may also be determined from the PROM monitor's
    "ok" prompt with the following command;
 
        ok .version
        Release 4.11.3  created 2003/07/11 13:30
        OBP 4.11.3 2003/07/11 13:30 Sun Serverblade1
        OBDIAG 4.11.3 2003/07/11 13:33  
 
 
2. Copy the OBP firmware upgrade to a known location on the blade
   server and extract its contents.
 
        cd /var/tmp
        unzip 115313-03
        cd 115313-03
