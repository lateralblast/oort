Patch Installation Instructions:
===============================
 
Intro
-----
 
    This README is intended for users who wish to upgrade the firmware
    in their Enterprise 250 system Flash PROM.
 
Summary of the Patch Installation Process:
------------------------------------------
 
The installation shall comprise of the following steps
 
1)  Determine the system's current Flash Prom firmware revision.
 
2)  Compare the current Flash Prom firmware revision with the available or 
    latest Flash Prom firmware revisions.
 
3)  If the current Flash Prom firmware revision is lower than the latest
    available firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step. 
    If NOT, STOP: DO NOT CONTINUE.
 
4)  Prepare the system for the Flash Prom update
 
5)  Running the Flash Prom Utility
 
6)  Verifying successful Flash Prom Update
 
7)  Restoring the system
 
8)  Resume operations
 
 
Patch Installation instructions (in detail):
============================================
 
NOTE: Due to differences in motherboard part numbers
      on the E250, once the -04 or greater patch is installed, you
      cannot return to the -01, -02, or -03 patch.
 
The required steps are explained in greater detail below.
 
1)  Determine the System's Current Firmware Revisions
    -------------------------------------------------
 
    While the OS is running the following command may be used to
    determine the current system firmware revisions;
 
	/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/prtdiag -v | grep OBP
	or
	/usr/sbin/prtconf -V
 
    The firmware revisions may also be determined from the PROM monitor's
    "ok" prompt with the following command;
 
	.version
 
2)  Compare the current Flash Prom firmware revision with the available or 
    latest Flash Prom firmware revisions.
 
    Compare the output of the OBP line in the "prtdiag -v" or "prtconf -V"   	
    output. Find the revision number and compare with the revision on the 
    entries below that of the "flash-update-250-latest" line
 
      Available Firmware Revisions
      ----------------------------
 
-latest flash-update-250-latest; flash-update-25-09
	OBP 3.30.0 2003/10/24 14:13
	POST 6.1.0 2000/12/20 16:21
	OBDIAG 4.5.1 2000/12/20 16:21
 
-08     flash-update-250-08
	OBP 3.28.0 2003/02/07 17:08
	POST 6.1.0 2000/12/20 16:21
	OBDIAG 4.5.1 2000/12/20 16:21
 
 
3)  Is the UPGRADE NECESSARY?
 
    If the current Flash PROM revision matches the version numbers given under
    the flash-update-250-latest line, then STOP Here. This UPGRADE IS NOT
    NECESSARY.
 
    If the current Flash Prom firmware revision is lower than the latest
    firmware revision in this patch, then proceed to the next step.
 
4) Preparing the System
   ---------------------
 
   Note: Please check the value of 'use-nvramrc' before any OBP FW upgrade
   and restore afterwards if necessary.
 
  a) As root, copy the "flash-update" files from the directory containing the 
     patch to the root directory as follows:
 
     # cp flash*latest  /
     # chmod 755 /flash-update*
 
     In order to boot the binary, it must be located within the root
     partition.  If it is not already located within the root partition
     then move it to /.  If the binary is already located elsewhere 
     within the root partition then note the exact filepath so that the
     binary can be booted later.
 
  b) As root, exit the OS such that the system returns to the PROM's "ok"
     prompt: 
 
     # halt
 
       ok
 
  c) Jumper J2704 is factory-set so that the flash PROM is write-enabled. 
     There is no need to switch the jumper before flash updating; however, 
     you must ensure that the keyswitch is in the Power-on or Diagnostics 
     position.  When the key switch is in the locked position the flash 
     PROM is write protected.
 
5)  Running the Flash Update Utility
    --------------------------------
 
  a) Reset the system.
 
     Wait for the PROM's banner to appear, and then
 
  b) use the Stop-A keys (or Break key, if running from a serial line) to
     abort the auto-boot sequence.
 
     ** NOTE **  If the flash update completes normally then the values
     contained within the system's Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) configuration
     variables will be retained.  However, if the update process is some-
     how interrrupted then it is possible that any non-default values
     contained in NVRAM will be lost.  For this reason it is recommended
     that you note down on paper the contents of any NVRAM configuration
     variable which has been customized so that they may be manually
     restored at a later time, if necessary.  (Use the PROM's "printenv"
     command to list the variables and their values.)
 
  c) The system should now display the PROM monitor's "ok" prompt.
     Now boot the Flash update utility as given below:
 
     CAUTION: Do not boot/run revisions lower than the latest unless you
	      are absolutely sure that that is what you want to do!
 
     ok boot disk /flash-update-250-latest
 
     NOTE: If your system's boot device is not "disk" then you will
           have to specify the appropriate devalias (e.g. disk2).
           If the binary is located in a location other than / then
           provide the entire filepath after the boot device.
 
     Answer the questions as prompted by the utility.

  Once the PROM's banner reappears then use the Stop-A keys (or Break
  key, if running from a serial line) to abort the auto-boot sequence
  if the system begins to boot.
 
6)  Verifying successful Flash Prom Update
 
    Verify from the results of the .version command that the OBP
    version matches the OBP version given above under the
    flash-update-250-latest entry in Step 2.
 
7)  Restoring the system
 
    If the keyswitch position has changed (it was in the locked position
    before flash updating) return it to its original position. 
 
    If any problems should be encountered during the firmware upgrade
    then consult the "Sun Flash PROM Guide for Workstations
    and Workgroup Servers - Standalone Version".
 
8)  Resume operations
 
    a) Reset the system and allow the system to boot the operating system.
 
    b) Once the system has rebooted you may wish to remove the Flash Update
       binaries and documents since they will no longer be needed.
 
       # rm /flash-update*
 
    c) Remember to remove the files from their original location if
       they were not extracted directly into the root directory.

Special Install Instructions:
----------------------------- 
 
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
*  PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND ENTIRELY.  PLEASE FOLLOW THE
   INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE STATED.
 
*  FAILURE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS COULD EITHER RESULT IN A DEFECTIVE BOARD OR
   UNSUCCESSFUL FLASH PROM UPDATE.
 
*  THIS IS NOT A STANDARD PATCH in that it does not use the installpatch
   and backoutpatch scripts.
 
*  THIS PATCH CANNOT BE INSTALLED ON AN ONLINE OPERATING SYSTEM BECAUSE
   THE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRES THAT THE SYSTEM BE BROUGHT DOWN.
   BE SURE TO SCHEDULE DOWN TIME TO INSTALL THIS PATCH.
 
*  INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH MAY REQUIRE A KEY SWITCH CHANGE. IF YOU ARE
   UNSURE ON HOW TO OPEN THE SYSTEM BOX, PLEASE ENSURE THAT A QUALIFIED 
   PERSON, WITH THE STATIC WRIST STRAP KIT NEEDED TO SERVICE ELECTRONIC
   EQUIPMENT, IS AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE THIS ACTIVITY. FAILURE TO USE STATIC
   PROTECTION KIT OR IMPROPER HANDLING COULD RESULT IN THE DAMAGE OF THE 
   SYSTEM BOARD.
 
*  PLEASE REVIEW NOT ONLY THIS README BUT ALSO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
   GIVEN.
   The file "802-3233-xx.ps" (where xx stands for the latest numeric
   revision) is a PostScript copy of the "Sun Flash PROM Guide for Workstations
   and Workgroup Servers - Standalone Version", which  provides the following;
 
   (i) Emergency instructions in the unlikely event that the Flash
        update should fail.
 
   Note, however, that The Programming Guide was originally written for 
   a user who is running the Flash PROM update utility from a bootable
   CDROM, and thus it will not contain the proper boot commands for
   installation of this patch.  Also note that the instructions in
   the document for installing packages are not valid for this patch.
