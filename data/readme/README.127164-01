Installation Instructions:
 
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownnership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
5. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
6. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 This Patch has two disk drive Firmware Installer Utilities.
 
 1. This patch includes firmware installing utility (mload) that
 is required for installing drive firmware in SE3310 RAID enclosures.
 2. This patch includes firmware downloading utility (download)
 that will upgrade or download code to drives in JBOD and certain RAID
 environments.
 
 This script(s) are intended for use on Solaris host systems only.
 
***********************************************************************
 
 To install the contents of this patch see the pertinent section below.
 
 Sections Index
 A. SE3310 System Installation Instructions
 B. JBOD and certain Non-SE33xx RAID System Installation Instructions
 
 
*****************************************************************************
*****************************************************************************
 
A. ******************SE3310 System Installation Instructions ***************
 
  Note: For Non 33xx Raid System Installation Instructions go to Section B.
 
An Ethernet connection for the StorEdge
   3310, or two connections if dual controllers are installed, with an
   IP address assigned, allowing the user to connect to the array via
   telnet, or a serial connection supporting a tip(1) connection to the
   array.  Two network connections are required for dual-controller
   configurations.  Refer to the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family Installation,
   Operation, and Service Manual for the Sun StorEdge 3310 SCSI Array,
   section 5.4.1 for procedures to connect to the array via tip.  Refer
   to the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family Installation, Operation, and Service
   Manual for the Sun StorEdge 3310 SCSI Array, Appendix B, section B.2
   for procedures to connect to the array via telnet.
 
 
Unpack the patch into any convenient directory such as /var/tmp, and refer
to the Special Install Instructions below.

Special Install Instructions:
-----------------------------
 
*** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning ***
 
This firmware upgrade procedure will prevent StorEdge 3310 arrays from
servicing normal I/O requests for three to five minutes.  For this
reason, all StorEdge 3310 logical disks should be unmounted from any
Solaris hosts connected to the array for the duration of the install
procedure.
 
1.FTP the .tar file to the machine used to monitor the system.
2.rlogin to the machine used to monitor the system.
3.Enter the command &gt;tar -xvf 127164-01.tar
4.cd  127164-01
5.Stop I/O to the StorEdge 3310 array.
 
6.  Verify the current controller firmware using the firmware
    application menu.  Choose "View System Information".  If the
    firmware version reported is 3.27Q or later, this patch will work.
 
 
7.  Make certain to quiesce the SCSI bus to the minnow.
 
8.  Open a terminal window on the host that will be used to download the
    firmware.  Change your working directory, if necessary, to the
    directory in which the patch was unpacked and confirm that the
    dk32ej14n.PQ0C.fw  file is present using the "ls" command.
 
9.  Type "./mload"
  at the command prompt. 
  mload will respond with:
 
Please Enter HOSTNAME OR 
IP ADDRESS Of SE 3xxx for upgrade: 
 
Enter the name or the IP Address of your System and Return.
 
10. To determine what type of disk drives you have, at the prompt type:
 
		mdload&gt; show disks
 
You will get a response that looks something like this:
