    It has the supporting tool for updating the SPARC and/or SMC firmwares.
 
    Tool Name : FWupdate
 
    Purpose   : To initiate system firmware update (SPARCFW &amp; SMCFW) at Solaris
                level.
 
    User      : Must be Super User to execute this script
 
    Usage     : FWupdate [-h]
                FWupdate [-F] -f &lt;filepath&gt; -d &lt;device&gt; -t &lt;FW type&gt;
 
                -h : Help, show usage
                -F : To Force the update when the Firmware is being downgraded
                -f : Complete filepath &amp; filename specified by following 
                     argument
                -t : Type of Firmware binary.
                     Possible options={sparc, smc, sparc+smc}
                -d : Complete path of device node or device alias specifying
                     the device where file is located
                     If disk is specified, the file must be in the root
                     directory. Also, the file cannot of a Symbolic link
 
 
    Points of interest:
 
    1) The complete filepath &amp; filename must be specified using -f option.
    2) Use -d option to specify the device from which the file may be loaded.
       User may specify the device either using a OBP device alias or using the
       complete path to the device node.
    3) If the file is located on a local disk then it must be in the root 
       directory and must not be a symbolic link.
    4) The tool performs a check on the version of SPARC Firmware. If a 
       downgrade is detected then the script would notify the user. A downgrade
       can only be updated using the force (-F) option.
    5) Tool does not perform a check on SMCFW version.
    6) Update script FWupdate and info file FWupdate.info must be in same 
       directory.
 
 
    Sample usage:
 
    Example 1:
 
    FWupdate -f &lt;full_path&gt;/CP2160.SPARC.1.0.20_SMC.4.1.3 -d net -t sparc+smc
 
    File is located on the NFS and is combined OBP &amp; SMC image
 
 
    Example 2:
 
    FWupdate -f /CP2160.SPARC.1.0.20_SMC.4.1.3 -d disk -t sparc+smc
 
    File is on a local disk in root directory and is combined OBP &amp; SMC image
 
 
    Example 3:
 
    FWupdate -f /CP2160.SMC.4.1.3 -d disk -t smc
 
    File is SMC flash binary located on local disk and is SMC image
 
 
2. Install image from OBP 'ok' prompt:
--------------------------------------
 
The images for flash-update
        CP2160.SPARC.1.0.20_SMC.4.1.3  - Combined Sparc and SMC image
        CP2160.SPARC.1.0.20            - Sparc image
        CP2160.SMC.4.1.3               - SMC image
 
 
o   From OS, do 'halt' and system will go to OBP 'ok' prompt.
 
o   Disable auto boot, if it is set to true.
 
        ok setenv auto-boot? false
 
 
o   Before flash-update the image, do 'reset-all' to reset the board.
 
o   Update image:
 
  *   Update Combined Sparc and SMC image
 
        ok flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2160.SPARC.1.0.20_SMC.4.1.3
 
 
  *   Update Sparc image
 
        ok flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2160.SPARC.1.0.20
 
 
  *   Update SMC image
 
        ok smc-flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2160.SMC.4.1.3
 
 
  *   Update SMC boot image
 
        ok smc-flash-update &lt;binary-path&gt;/CP2160.SMC.BOOT.3.15.9
 
 
o   After update Sparc only image, do 'reset-all' to reset the CP2160 board.
 
    Note:
        After flash-update a combined image or a smc-flash-update SMC image,
        the CP2160 board will take a hardware reset as soon as the update
        process is finished.
 
 
o   Set auto-boot? to true if it is needed.
 
        ok setenv auto-boot? true
