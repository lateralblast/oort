Patch Installation Instructions:
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownnership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
   If it is deemed desirable to also download the book disk it will be
   necessary to reboot the machine. PLEASE NOTE THAT FOR THIS CASE ALL 
   PRECAUTIONS NECCESARY FOR REBOOT MUST BE OBSERVED OR DATA LOSS WILL OCCUR.
	In that case, and that case only, 
   perform the following:
	A. su to root
	B. enter the root password
	C. enter the command "init 0"
	D. at the "ok" prompt, give the command boot -s
	When the computer completes bootup it will be in single-user mode.	
	When all download procedures are complete, give the command "init 6".
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
5. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
6. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.
 
7. FTP the .tar file to the machine used to monitor the system.
 
8. rlogin to the machine used to monitor the system.
 
9. Enter the command #gunzip 116369-11.tar.Z
 
9. Enter the command #tar -xvf 116369-11.tar
 
10. Enter the command #cd  116369-11

Installation Notes:
--------------------------------
 This Patch has two disk drive Firmware Installer Utilities.
 
 1. This patch includes firmware installing utility (mload) that
 is required for installing drive firmware in SE3310 RAID enclosures.
 2. This patch includes firmware downloading utility (download)
 that will upgrade or download code to drives in NON-RAID
 environment.
 3. This patch is for SUN SCSI JBOD and A3xxx series only.
    The patch CANNOT be downloaded if the drives are in a RAID
	environment EXCEPT for SE3310, A1000, A3000 and A3500.
	Before installing this patch any and all Software AND OR
	Hardware RAID should be disabled EXCEPT for SE3310, A1000, A3000 and A3500.
 4. This script(s) are intended for use on Solaris SPARC host systems only.
 
***********************************************************************
 
 To install firmware via this patch see the pertinent section below.
 
 Sections Index
 A. SE3310 Drive Firmware Download Instructions
 B. JBOD and Non-SE33xx Drive Firmware Download Instructions
 
 
*****************************************************************************
*****************************************************************************
 
A. *******************SE3310 Drive Firmware Download Instructions************
 
  Note: For Non 33xx Raid System Installation Instructions go to Section B.
 
   An Ethernet connection for the StorEdge
   SE3310 is needed. An IP address assigned is also needed. This allows the 
   user to connect to the array via telnet, or a serial connection supporting
   a tip(1) connection to the array.  Two network connections are required 
   for dual-controller configurations, one for each controller.  Refer to 
   the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family Installation, Operation, and Service Manual 
   for the Sun StorEdge 3310 SCSI Array, section 5.4.1 for procedures to 
   connect to the array via tip.  Refer to the Sun StorEdge 3000 Family 
   Installation, Operation, and Service Manual for the Sun StorEdge 3310 SCSI 
   Array, Appendix B, section B.2 for procedures to connect to the array 
   via telnet.
 
 
Unpack the patch into any convenient directory such as /var/tmp, and refer
to the instructions below.
 
*** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning *** Warning ***
 
This firmware upgrade procedure will prevent StorEdge 3310 arrays from
servicing normal I/O requests for three to five minutes.  For this
reason, all StorEdge 3310 logical disks should be unmounted from any
Solaris hosts connected to the array for the duration of the install
procedure.
 
1.  Stop I/O to the StorEdge 3310 array.
 
2.  Verify the current controller firmware using the firmware
    application menu.  Choose "View System Information".  If the
    firmware version reported is 3.25Q or later, this patch will work.
 
 
3.  Make certain to quiesce the SCSI bus to the minnow.
 
4.  Open a terminal window on the host that will be used to download the
    firmware.  Change your working directory, if necessary, to the
    directory in which the patch was unpacked and confirm that the
    DK32EJ36N.PQ0F.fw  file is present using the "ls" command.
 
5.  Type "./mload"
  at the command prompt. 
  mload will respond with:
 
Please Enter HOSTNAME OR IP ADDRESS Of SE 3xxx for upgrade: 
 
Enter the name or the IP Address of your System and Return.
 
6. To determine what type of disk drives you have, at the prompt type:
 
		mdload&gt; show disks
 
You will get a response that looks something like this:

B.******* JBOD and Non-SE33xx Drive Firmware Download Instructions **********
 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is explained below. 
Upgrade time will be approximately 2 minutes per drive for systems.
 
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
	% su root
	# cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
	# tar xf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
 
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
	# ./download
 
c). Select the devices to be upgraded (see example below).
 
**NOTE**    Any device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
 
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console 
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  It is
            normal for the SCSI link to go offline for a few
            seconds and then return to the online state.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.
 
**NOTE**    For A3000/1000's, the internal disk "C" and "T" numbers
            are derived from the first active controller found.  The
            "D" number is encoded to indicate it's position using the
            following formula:  D = (tray_number * 100) + target_id.
 
d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
 
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
 
e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).
 
f). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit' (see example below).

SDS, or Vold) should be running.  Other host systems sharing
any I/O bus with this host must either be offline or
disconnected.  Any interruption (e.g. power loss) during
upgrade can result in damage to devices being upgraded.
 
Any disk to be upgraded should first have its data backed up.
