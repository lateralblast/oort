NOTE 4: General guidelines for upgrading:
 
        BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
 
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
 
        UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgraded.
        Drives with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.
 
        UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
 
        REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any drives from
        volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
        not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
 
        UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
        the procedure section below.
 
To install rel8862SunPhyParams.bin in a Solaris environment,
 
 
	Download Oracle Hardware Management Pack (fwupdate) along with 
	supporting documentation at the link below:
	http://www.sun.com/systemmanagement/managementtools.jsp
 
	Download the "Sun Server CLI Tools and IPMItool 2.0 User's Guide" 
	(PN: 821-1600-xx). Follow the instructions provided in this manual to 
	install and configure Server Hardware Management Pack.  Once it is 
	successfully installed, proceed with upgrading the firmware on your 
	device via the `fwupdate` command.  Instructions on using the `fwupdate`
	command are provided in the User's Guide referenced above.
	http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/prod/svrmgmt.pack2?l=en&amp;a=view 
 
 
 
1) Identify which SSD device you wish to upgrade with the following command:
 
# /usr/bin/fwupdate list
 
For example, in Solaris:
   # /usr/bin/fwupdate list disk
 
 
CONTROLLER c0
=============
Manufacturer   Model     Product Name                  F/W Version         BIOS Version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LSI Logic      0x0058    -                             -                   -
 
DISKS
===============
ID      Brand       Model               Chassis Slot   Type   Media   Size (GB)Firmware Revision
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c0d1    INTEL       SSDSA2SH03          -       -      sata   SSD     31       8855
c0d2    INTEL       SSDSA2SH03          -       -      sata   SSD     31       8855
c0d3    INTEL       SSDSA2SH03          -       -      sata   SSD     31       8855
 
2) To install the new firmware on the target Intel SSD, type the following command:
 
# /usr/bin/fwupdate update
 
For example, in Solaris:
# /usr/bin/fwupdate update disk-firmware -n c0d1 -f rel8862SunPhyParams.bin
* The example above assumes rel8862SunPhyParams.bin is in the current directory.
* The example above shows how to update the Intel SSD at c0d1
 
3) Verify that the new firmware 8862 was installed correctly on the target Intel SSD (in this case c0d1):
 
# /usr/bin/fwupdate list
 
For example, in Solaris:
# /usr/bin/fwupdate list disk
 
CONTROLLER c0
=============
Manufacturer   Model     Product Name                  F/W Version         BIOS Version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LSI Logic      0x0058    -                             -                   -
 
DISKS
===============
ID      Brand       Model               Chassis Slot   Type   Media   Size (GB)Firmware Revision
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
c0d1    INTEL       SSDSA2SH03          -       -      sata   SSD     31       8862
c0d2    INTEL       SSDSA2SH03          -       -      sata   SSD     31       8855
c0d3    INTEL       SSDSA2SH03          -       -      sata   SSD     31       8855
 
Notice that the firmware version of Intel SSD at c0d1 has been updated to 8862
 
4) Repeat the same procedure mentioned in step (2) for all the remaining Intel SSDs.
