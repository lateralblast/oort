Problem Description:

This Patch is a consolidation of older Patches and new firmware required for legacy Seagate FC-AL Drives.
 
The  patch has the following bug fixes :
 
4363994 Solaris 8 not listed as supported OS for patch 108104-03
		Fixes Patch 108104-03 Read Me file to include Solaris 8 as supportd OS.
 
4519031 T3 vol init command can take 8 hours to complete
		Fixes merge code problem to prevent performance degradation on 
		queued-sequential writes (known as the Slow Vol Init problem).
 
no bug id	Changed F/W to set value of the FTEC482 Internal Transceiver Pole/Zero
   		register from 0x31 to 0x32 to address the Excalibur bootup issue
 
Previous History:
 
The following disk drive models have been moved to other patches- 
 
 ST336607FC  (moved to patch 113671-01 to be PatchPro-compatible) 
 ST336753FC  (moved to patch 116748-02 to be PatchPro-compatible) 
 ST373307FC  (moved to patch 114708-02 to be PatchPro-compatible) 
 ST373453FC  (moved to patch 113673-01 to be PatchPro-compatible) 
 MAN3735F    (moved to patch 116513-01) 
 ST3146807FC (moved to patch 114709-02 to be PatchPro-compatible) 
 
 All ch3 FlashROM codes moved to patch 111535-03 for FCO A0199 control.
 All ch4 FlashROM codes moved to patch 113668-03 for FCO A0222 control.
 
This revision of this patch removes the 0938 cheetah5 fw and replaces it with the previous
version of 0638 fw. This was done because a bug was found in booting the V880 platform
(the timing can cause the V880 to panic on boot). There are no known bugs in the 0638
version (the 0938 version was feature enhancements) so it is appropriate to revert to
this version.
 
The previous Patches for the drives which are incorporated into this patch are as follows:
 
Drive Model#	Patch #		FWCode  	Previous FWs

**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownnership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
5. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
6. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 
1. General guidelines for upgrading: 
 
	BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
 
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
 
	UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.
 
	UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
 
	REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
	volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
	not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
 
	UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
	the procedure section below.
 
	In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the 
	relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be 
	that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen 
	as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file 
	being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.
 
**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting of the Solaris 2.6 release CD.
 
**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligible for upgrade.
 
	RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.
 
**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.
 
 
 
2. Procedure: 
 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the drive firmware is
explained below. Upgrade time will be approximately 2 minutes
for systems.
 
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
	% su root
	# cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
	# tar xf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
 
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
	# ./download
 
c). Select the devices to be upgraded (see example below).
 
**NOTE**    Any device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
 
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console 
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  It is
            normal for the FC-AL link to go offline for a few
            seconds and then return to the online state.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.
 
**NOTE**    For A3000/1000's, the internal disk "C" and "T" numbers
            are derived from the first active controller found.  The
            "D" number is encoded to indicate it's position using the
            following formula:  D = (tray_number * 100) + target_id.
 
d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
 
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
 
e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).
 
**NOTE**    Only the first two digits of the firmware version number
            will change.  The last two digits will not change.
            So, a disk with 0410 firmware would report revision
            1078 for example.
 
f). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit' (see example below).

	  and may not reflect the exact model/firmware you wish to download. 
 
# ./download
Firmware Download Utility, V4.2
 
**************************  WARNING  **************************
NO OTHER ACTIVITY IS ALLOWED DURING FIRMWARE UPGRADE!!!
No other programs including any volume manager (e.g. Veritas,
SDS, or Vold) should be running.  Other host systems sharing
any I/O bus with this host must either be offline or
disconnected.  Any interruption (e.g. power loss) during
upgrade can result in damage to devices being upgraded.
 
Any disk to be upgraded should first have its data backed up.
