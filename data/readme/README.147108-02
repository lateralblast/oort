BugId's fixed with this patch: 6961602 6978258 ID Long WWN dither fix fix. reliability term unique

Changes incorporated in this version: 
Note:
- Seagate's analysis on the field returned drives showed that the drive
dither operation was not functioning properly. During the write
operation to save the log pages to the system zone the operation was
being completed without disabling the pre-heat or seeking away from
the system zone. 
- The early 15K5 SCSI drives were not assigned a WWN and when these
drives get updated to FW 0692, mode page 83 WWN would show that there
is a WWN but is default to zeros "000000000". This caused the drives that
initially without a WWN not to have a unique WWN.   FW 0892 has the fix
that would set the bits on page 83 on these early drives to show that the drive
does not have a WWN and remove the zeros.  The system then will use the
drive SN to create a unique WWN.  Drives with an assigned WWN will
not get changed. 
- D240 specific 15K5 SCSI drive FW is updated from A692 to A792
This D240 f/w only has the dither /STIR fix

Installation Instructions:
 
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. The system MUST BE IDLE during the download process!  No other
   programs should be running while using this utility is being
   used.  Failure to do so may cause the devices being upgraded
   to fail or the system to crash.
 
   Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownnership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
5. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
6. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.
