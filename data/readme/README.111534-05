Problem Description:

1. Increases disk drive reliability due to HDI failures impacts customers 
   operations.  
   Drive goes offline with sense code 02x04.
 
2. For 111534-05, only changed download32 and download64 utility to fix 
   bug #4757400 when cd media is in cdrom drive
 
 
Code Change List:
 
1. All changes are associated with Idle/Sweep function.
   It's not only removing 5 sec idle, but changed and fixed some logical
   errors in Idle/Sweep.
   For example, if seek error happened before starting idle function.... and
   so on. The difference is only in Idle / Sweep function.
 
 
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
**WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:****WARNING:**
 
1. Volume managers such as Veritas, SDS, Arraymon, and Vold must
   be idle and any disks unconfigured.  Note, due to an open/close
   accounting bug (see bug 4129295) in sd and ssd drivers, you must
   reboot the system after unconfiguring any disks used by them.
   This accounting bug prevents the upgrade utility from acquiring
   sole ownership of the disk so it will not be eligible for upgrade.
   Note, Arraymon will be disabled during download startup and enabled
   on exit.
 
   Any other computers sharing the same I/O bus as the host system
   must be either disconnected or offline to prevent possible
   disruption of the firmware download process.
 
2. If any upgrade failures occur, do not continue upgrading devices.
   Loss of power during download can result in damage to the devices
   under upgrade and require replace.
 
   If any failures occur, please collect the following log files:
   "./download.log" or "/var/tmp/download.log", "/var/adm/messages",
   and an explorer dump.  Please forward these files to your service
   provider for analysis. 
 
3. This package will only upgrade the identified Sun disks.
 
4. This package does not support T3 subsystems.  Internal T3 disks
   are upgraded as part of the T3-specific package.
 
5. If the High Availability kernel device polling is running, it will
   be disabled.  It will not be re-enabled.
 
6. If using Veritas, "deport" the volume to release the volume from
   Veritas control.  Do not "remove" the volume as this will erase
   the data stored on the Volume.
 
7. If you have reconfigured A1000/3000 SCSI systems, the /dev
   directories may become corrupted.  Download will detect this problem
   and ask for permission to repair the problem.  If not repaired,
   affected devices will not be eligible for upgrade.
 
8. If you have dual-active A1000/3000 controllers and one of the 
   controllers has no luns, they will not be eligible for upgrade.
   This is because an access path is only provided if a controller
   has luns.  Without an access path, the controller cannot be
   accessed and both controllers are required for upgrade operations.
 
   The faster responding dual-active controller will be displayed.
   So, there can be some display variation.  This does not impact
   download operation as it uses both controllers.
 
9. If you have dual-independent A1000/3000 controllers where each
   controller is attached to a different host system, they will not
   be eligible for upgrade unless one controller is removed from
   the A1000/3000.  You will also need to manually determine which
   disks are owned by the installed controller and manually specify
   them for upgrade.  If you specify a disk owned by the removed
   controller download will fail.  Once yo have upgraded one controller,
   you need to switch controllers...that is installed the previously
   removed controller and remove the installed controller.  Repeat
   the upgrade process from the other host system.  After completion,
   you can install the removed controller and resume normal operation.
 
   If controllers have no luns, they will not be eligible for upgrade.
   This is because an access path is only provided if a controller
   has luns.  Without an access path, the controller cannot be
   accessed and both controllers are required for upgrade operations.
 
   The faster responding dual-active controller will be displayed.
   So, there can be some display variation.  This does not impact
   the download operation.
 
10. Follow the instructions given below.  You may program one drive,
   a range of drives, or all drives at once with this tool.

Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 
1. General guidelines for upgrading: 
 
        Previous firmware versions which are upgradable to this level:
 
                        S9WE
 
        BACK UP ALL FILESYSTEMS.
 
        STOP ALL APPLICATIONS. The system must be idle during the
        firmware upgrade process.
 
        UNMOUNT all file systems on the drives to be upgrade.
        Disks with mounted file systems are not eligible for
        upgrade.
 
        UNCONFIGURE devices from volume manager.
 
        REBOOT THE SYSTEM if you unconfigured any disks from
        volume manager (e.g. Veritas).  Otherwise, you will
        not be able to upgrade any previously configured disks.
 
        UPGRADE the disks.  Follow the given instructions in
        the procedure section below.
 
        In case of any disruption or unforeseen events happening on the 
        relevant bus during the firmware download process, it may be 
        that the upgraded disk becomes non-functional.  In this event,
        it will be necessary to swap out the disk. This would happen 
        as a result of an incomplete or corrupted firmware file 
        being downloaded.  Loss of power during the upgrade process
        would also damage the disk.
 
**NOTE**    If you cannot upgrade devices due to volume manager
            interference,  try booting off the Solaris 2.6 release CD.
 
**NOTE**    If a system disk is to be upgraded, the upgrade utility will
            allow it to be upgraded if the system is in single-user mode
            (e.g. "boot -s").  Otherwise, the system disk will not be
            eligible for upgrade.
 
        RECONFIGURE devices to volume manager.
 
**NOTE**    As Download disables kernel high availability device polling,
            it may be necessary to reboot the system to restart it.
 
 
 
2. Procedure: 
 
The procedure to be used for upgrading the DDYST1835 DDYST3695 drive
firmware is explained below. Upgrade time will be approximately
5 minutes for the system above Solaris 2.4.  For Solaris 2.4 and 2.3,
the upgrade cycle will be 30 Seconds per disk.
 
a) Unpack the patch (through tar) into any directory, say &lt;patchdir&gt;.
   (Note, if the patch ends in a ".Z" suffix, you will need to first
   uncompress it.)  So, you would type:
        % su root
        # cd &lt;patchdir&gt;
        # tar xf &lt;patch tar file&gt;
 
b) In the patch directory, as root, type the "download" command:
        # ./download
 
c). Enter the appropriate devices to be upgraded.  You can upgrade
    a single device, a group of devices, or all devices at once. 
 
** See the example below**.
 
**NOTE**    A device that is in-use by another application will not
            be upgraded.  The following warning message will be
            issued:   c1t3d0s0: Open failed, you must be the sole user!
 
**NOTE**    This upgrade can result in error messages in the console 
            window and/or the terminal "download" window.  The disk
            mode pages will also be restored to the default values.
 
d). After the devices have been upgraded, the displayed device
    list will be refreshed.  Devices remaining to be upgraded or
    failed devices will be displayed.  Failed devices will be
    marked with a "****" in the rev field.
 
**NOTE**    If all devices have been upgraded, the following
            message will be displayed:   No devices found to upgrade!
 
e). To display the full list of devices including the upgrades ones,
    type 'inquiry' (see example below).
 
f). Quit the "download" program by typing 'quit'.

EXAMPLE: 
# csh
 
# ./download
Firmware Download Utility, V4.2
 
**************************  WARNING  **************************
NO OTHER ACTIVITY IS ALLOWED DURING FIRMWARE UPGRADE!!!
No other programs including any volume manager (e.g. Veritas,
SDS, or Vold) should be running.  Other host systems sharing
any I/O bus with this host must either be offline or
disconnected.  Any interruption (e.g. power loss) during
upgrade can result in damage to devices being upgraded.
 
Any disk to be upgraded should first have its data backed up.
