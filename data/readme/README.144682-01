Patch Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
 
QNEM I4 (I4A and I4B) firmware update instructions (load 7.3.0 code: 
	520-4148-03-50.BIN and 520-4150-03-50.BIN respectively to address 
	CR_6926093, CR_7013720, and CR_6924849):
  1. Download "flint", an advanced firmware utility from Mellanox that is 
	included in MFT package, from their website.
 
http://mellanox.com/content/pages.php?pg=management_tools&amp;menu_section=34
 
  2. Query LIDs for both I4A and I4B in qnem by running this command from a 
	linux host: 
 	# ibswitches
 
   Note: I4A and I4B have their own LID numbers. I4 A will have a nodedesc of
      "Sun Blade 6048 InfiniBand QNEM I4A" and I4B will have a nodedesc of
      "Sun Blade 6048 InfiniBand QNEM I4B".   This is how to determine which
       lids to upgrade.
 
  3. Copy both firmware files to the local machine. I4A and I4B files are 
	different.
 
  4. Update the QNEM with new firmware like this:
          # flint -d lid-A -i &lt;I4A_image&gt; b
          # flint -d lid-B -i &lt;I4B_image&gt; b
 
      where A is the LID number for I4A switch, and B is the LID number for I4B
      switch. This needs to be run for both I4A and I4B switches separately.
 
  5. Reset I4A and I4B switches to make the new firmware effective:
          # flint -d lid-A  swreset
          # flint -d lid-B  swreset
      where A is the LID number for I4A switch, and B is the LID number for I4B
      switch. This needs to be run for both I4A and I4B switches separately.
 
  6. After reseted the QNEM, wait for about 30 seconds. Then make sure the
     new QNEM firmware was updated properly:
    # flint -d lid-A q
    # flint -d lid-B q
      where A is the LID number for I4A switch, and B is the LID number for I4B
      switch. This needs to be run for both I4A and I4B switches separately.
      The QNEM firmware can be verified to be updated by verifying the FW 
     	Version field and the Product Version field.
  7. Update the FPGA code to -04 (520-4147-02.rbf) via CMM per the 
	accompanying instructions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QNEM FPGA update instructions (load -04 code: 520-4147-02.rbf to address 
	CR_6999580):
 
   1. Use the version command in ILOM to make sure the C48 CMM ILOM
      version is 3.0.10.15.b or newer, for example:
 
    -&gt; version
 
    CMM firmware 3.0.10.15.b
    CMM firmware build number: 57573
    CMM firmware date: Fri Jul 23 08:08:58 EDT 2010
    CMM filesystem version: 0.1.22
 
    Please note that this upgraded requires the IB fabric is idle, because
    the IB fabric will loose connectivity to these QNEM's during the FPGA
    upgrade due to the reset and our recommendation is to quiesce the 
    fabric i.e. shut it down for this upgrade or the subnet manager may get 
    over run will traps.
 
   2. To use fpgautil in restricted shell, first you need to enter restricted
      shell by doing:
 
    -&gt; set SESSION mode=restricted
 
   3. From the restricted shell, to update the QNEM FPGA by using the fpgautil
      command, and the syntax is:
 
    fpgautil -p -n=NEM_SLOT  URL
 
    where:
    -p means program the QNEM
    NEM_SLOT is just 1 for QNEM
    URL is a valid URL, starting with tftp://, http:// or ftp://. For example:
 
    fpgautil -p -n=1  ftp://root:password@192.168.2.201/520-4147-02.rbf
    fpgautil -p -n=1  tftp://192.168.2.201/520-4147-02.rbf
    fpgautil -p -n=1  http://192.168.2.171/520-4147-02.rbf
 
    Note that the CMM does not have the ability to use URL based proxy access
    consequently the file will need to be served from a network localized file 
    server.
 
   4. After you updated the QNEM FPGA, use the exit command to exit the 
      restricted shell and return to the CMM ILOM, for example:
    [(restricted_shell) SUNCMM-0000000000:~]# exit
    exit
    -&gt;
 
   5. Reseat the QNEM:
      Remove the QNEM from C48 chassis, then wait for 20 seconds,  and
      then plug the QNEM back in the C48 chassis.
 
   6. From CMM ILOM, start the QNEM proxy cli, and then issue the " show
      fpga_version " command from QNEM proxy to make sure the QNEM FPGA
      was updated to version 04, for example:
 
    -&gt; start /CH/NEM1/SP/cli
    Are you sure you want to start /CH/NEM1/SP/cli (y/n)? y
    start: Warning, using proxy program from /coredump/proxy-0c1c
 
 
    Sun Blade 6048 QDR InfiniBand Network Express Module
 
    -&gt;
    -&gt; show fpga_version
 
    NEM1
      Targets:
 
      Properties:
         fpga_version        = 04
