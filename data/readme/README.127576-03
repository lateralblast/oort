NOTE 2: By using Sun System Firmware (Firmware) you agree to the terms of the
        Software License Agreement and Entitlement (SLA/Entitlement) found in
        Sun_System_Firmware-6_5-download_SLA_and_Entitlement.txt.  By using the 
        Firmware, you agree to the terms of the SLA/Entitlement. If you do not
        agree to all of the terms promptly destroy the unused Firmware.
 
NOTE 3: This patch supports both the Sun Fire T2000 and now the APL SPARC
        Enterprise T2000 product lines, which share the same firmware.  We
        include two separate Sun System Firmware binary files, with different
        names corresponding to the respective products. The different names are
        provided for convenience - the two files are otherwise identical.  For
        the Sun Fire T2000, upgrading to Sun System 6.5.11 (or later) requires
        Solaris 10 Update 1 (or later) to be installed.
 
        The system may experience boot or other problems with earlier version of
        Solaris (S10_HW2).
 
        SPARC Enterprise T2000 (APL) configurations require Solaris 10 Update 3
        (or later) to be installed.
 
 
NOTE 4: Please refer to the online documentation for feature and version
        compatibility between Sun System Firmware and LDom Manager releases.
