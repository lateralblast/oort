  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RTIF2-150225-001:

  [Problem]
   If the input voltage drops instantaneously on the system with 
   the PCI expansion unit connected, a failure of the power
   supply unit (PSU) of the PCI expansion unit may be detected by
   mistake, and the Check LED (amber) of the PCI expansion unit may go on.
   You can confirm this symptom with the showlogs error -v command. If
   the execution result of the showlogs error -v command is "Msg:PSU failed"
   or "PSU failed(PSU) shortage)" and the fourth line of the Diagnostic Code
   has the following values, the symptom corresponds to this problem.
   1) Fourth byte: the left-most (x80) bit is 0 (any of 0*, 1*, 2*, 3*, 4*, 
      5*, 6*, and 7*), and
   2) Fourth byte: the seventh (x02) bit from the left is 0 (any of *0, *1, 
      *4, *5, *8, *9, *c, and *d), and
   3) Fifth byte: the left-most (x80) bit is 0 (any of 0*, 1*, 2*, 3*, 4*, 
      5*, 6*, and 7*), and
   4) Seventh byte: the left-most (x80) bit is 0 and the second (x40) bit 
      from the left is 0 (any of 0*, 1*, 2*, and 3*).
