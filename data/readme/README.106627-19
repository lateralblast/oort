Patch Installation Instructions:
-------------------------------- 
 
For Solaris 2.0-2.6 releases, refer to the Install.info file and/or
the README within the patch for instructions on using the generic
'installpatch' and 'backoutpatch' scripts provided with each patch.
 
For Solaris 7 release, refer to the man pages for instructions on
using 'patchadd' and 'patchrm' scripts provided with Solaris.
Any other special or non-generic installation instructions should be
described below as special instructions.  The following example
installs a patch to a standalone machine:
 
       example# patchadd /var/spool/patch/104945-02
 
The following example removes a patch from a standalone system:
 
       example# patchrm 104945-02
 
For additional examples please see the appropriate man pages.

Special Install Instructions:
----------------------------- 
 
Reboot the system after patch installation
 
NOTE 1: For Solaris 2.6, one must install the following patches:
 
                105181-17 (or newer)    kernel update patch
                106625-06 (or newer)    ufs patch
 
 
NOTE 2: For Solaris 7, one must install this patch
 
                106541-07 (or newer)    kernel update patch
 
NOTE 3: Users who have created soft partitions on disks/slices larger than
        4gb with SDS 4.2 patch 106627-18 installed will need to install
        patch 106627-19 (or newer) and either
 
        clear the softpartitions and recreate them
 
        OR
 
        regenerate the soft partition configuration information using the
        metarecover command. Use the -m option which regenerates the 
        extent headers.
 
 
Upgrading from SDS 4.2 with soft partitions to a later release.
---------------------------------------------------------------
 
If the soft partitioning feature, that is delivered by this patch, is used
you cannot directly upgrade SDS 4.2 to a later release with this type of device.
Instead you need to clear and re-create the devices on the later release,
using the same start block and length. To do this, follow this procedure :
 
        1. use metastat -p to gather the information needed to re-create
           the existing soft partitions, eg :
 
# metastat -p
d0 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 2161 -b 204800
d1 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 206962 -b 1024000
d2 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 1230963 -b 102400
d3 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 1333364 -b 2097152
 
        2. metaclear the existing soft partitions ONLY. Comment out any
           entries in /etc/vfstab that refer to them.
 
        3. upgrade the software according the the release notes for the new
           version. Ensure you have applied any necessary patches and
           have re-created any necessary underlying metadevices.
 
        4. use the previously collected information to re-create the
           soft partitions, eg :
 
# metainit d0 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 2161 -b 204800
# metainit d1 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 206962 -b 1024000
# metainit d2 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 1230963 -b 102400
# metainit d3 -p c0t0d0s7 -o 1333364 -b 2097152
 
           This will re-make the devices, using the same start and end points.
 
        5. fsck and mount any filesystems on the soft partitions.
 
Disksets
--------
 
If the soft partition feature, supplied by this patch, is being used
within a diskset, then the procedure above must be followed for those
soft partitions in the diskset with the additional steps of taking and
releasing the set using the metaset (1M) command.
 
If the diskset can be owned by different hosts, then consideration must
be given as to when to convert the soft partitions, with the first node
or the last node to be upgraded. Nodes must not import the diskset once
it has been converted until they have been upgraded themselves.
