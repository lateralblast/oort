Firmware Information Right In The Hand

Introduction
------------

This script parses the Oracle (and in the future other) firmware pages to get
firmware information. It returns the versions of firmware (top most is the current)
and their URLs. It can also download the firmware to a local repository if needed.

Long term this script will hopefully slowly bring the various firmware information
tools I have into one script.

Features:

- Get a list of available system firmware for particular model(s)
- Get a list of available XCF firmware for particular M series model(s)
- Get a list of available SRUs for Solaris 11
- Search Oracle Solaris patchdiag.xref patch list (Solaris 10 and earlier)
- Download system firmware for particular model(s)
- Download XCF firmware for particular M series model(s)
- Get a list of firware for Emulex or QLogic Fibre Channel adaptor(s)
- Get a list of firmware for disks(s)
- Extract version information from system firmware download
  - Useful for documentation
  - Can be used in conjunction with [sice](https://github.com/lateralblast/sice) script to update firmware
- Create a local repository of patches

Information
-----------

The Oracle downloads require a support contract and a MOS account. To prevent
the possibility of displaying username and password details the script sets the
WGETRC environment variable to read them from a file. If the file does not exist
it will ask you for the details and create a file. The files permission are set
so only you can read it, e.g.

```
$ cat ~/.mospasswd
http-user=Firstname.Lastname@company.com
http-password=P@$$w0r]
check-certificate=off
```
